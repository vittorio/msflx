            <p>One of the remarkable things about the modern
            airplane engine is its reliability. In fact, it's
            considered the norm for a pilot to fly an entire career
            in a small, piston powered airplane and never
            experience a catastrophic engine failure. Yet, even
            when an engine does fail it seldom meant &quot;curtains&quot; for
            the pilot. What was once an airplane with a perfectly
            good running engine now becomes a semi-efficient glider
            with a large useless weight in front. The fact is that
            properly trained pilots can successfully cope with an
            engine failure.</p>

            <p>In this lesson you'll be introduced to several
            techniques for handling an engine failure in the
            Beechcraft Baron 58. Of course, the Baron is a
            multiengine airplane, and the failure of a single
            engine requires some very special training that is
            beyond the scope of this session. That's why this
            lesson will specifically cover how to handle a double
            engine failure. Granted, a double engine failure is
            rare, but it can happen, especially if you are having a
            bit of bad luck. (In other words, this wouldn't be the
            best time for you to invest in a Lotto ticket). Fuel
            contamination, fuel starvation, and fuel exhaustion are
            just a few of the reasons pilots have invented to see
            to it that both engines cease operating at the same
            time. Despite the experience of a double engine failure
            in a Baron, this lesson will provide you with useful
            principles for handling an engine failure in any of
            Flight Simulator's single-engine airplanes,
            too.</p><a name="The Big Picture"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">The Big Picture</p>

            <p>Before we jump into our discussion of engine failure
            procedures, here's a basic description of what will
            happen during the flight portion of this lesson.</p>

            <p>You'll begin the lesson in cruise configuration
            while flying at 170 knots approximately five miles
            south of Paine field in the state of Washington. Both
            engines will quit simultaneously. Making the
            &quot;brrrrrrrrrrrrr&quot; engine sound with your pursed lips
            won't bring the engines back on line. Besides, it could
            fog up the windshield.</p>

            <p>Your first action will be to lower the airplane's
            nose to establish the proper glide speed. Then you'll
            run through the engine failure checklist in an attempt
            to restart the engines. Of course, the engines won't
            restart because that would defeat the purpose of the
            lesson. Next, you'll activate the GPS and find the
            nearest airport. (I've already given you a hint where
            it's at.) You'll fly to the center of that airport,
            circle down from above, and land on a runway of your
            choosing. (Even though both engines fail in the Baron,
            I'll speak of the engines in the singular, rather than
            the plural for this lesson. This will help make the
            lesson applicable to single-engine airplanes, too.)</p>

            <p>That's the big picture. Are you ready for juicy
            details? OK, let the games begin, or, in instructor
            talk, &quot;Let the engines stop.&quot;</p><a name=

            <p>Very few things are as certain as the proper
            piloting behavior that follows a failed engine. The
            moment your engine goes on strike you should
            immediately lower the nose to the pitch attitude that
            will provide the maximum range glide speed. In the
            Baron, this speed is 115 knots (Figure 3-1). What does
            the <em>maximum range glide speed</em> give you? Here's a
            hint: Who's buried in Grant's tomb? It gives you the
            chance to glide the greatest horizontal distance for
            your present altitude (we'll assume this is a <em>no
            wind</em> condition for all these examples).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You might be surprised to know that most piston
            powered airplanes have glide ranges of approximately 10
            to 1 (Figure 3-2). No, those aren't the odds that you
            won't make the landing field, either. This value
            indicates that if you're 1,000 feet above ground level
            you can glide 10,000 feet horizontally. This is pretty
            impressive considering that some purpose-built gliders
            have glide ratios beginning somewhere around 18 to 1.
            An airplane without an operating engine is a slightly
            inefficient glider, but it's a glider nevertheless.
            With a 10:1 glide ratio, you have a good chance of
            finding a farmer's field or an airport on which to land
            the airplane. Of course, it's preferable to put the
            airplane down at an airport instead of a field whenever
            possible, for several reasons. The most compelling of
            which is that you won't find airplane mechanics
            standing around farmer's fields unless they're
            moonlighting as scarecrows.</p>

            <p>Once the maximum range glide attitude is established
            and the airplane trimmed, you now have an important
            choice to make. If you're close to the ground when the
            failure occurs, there's not much time to troubleshoot
            the problem. Your first priority in this instance is to
            find a place to land because that's what you're about
            to do. On the other hand, if an engine fails in cruise
            flight, you have a little more time and can run though
            the engine failure checklist before having to focus
            solely on the landing. How you handle an engine failure
            between takeoff and cruise flight is based on your
            assessment of the altitude available and the
            environment over which you're flying.</p>

            <p>Since this lesson's engine failure occurs in cruise
            flight, you should have just enough time to quickly run
            through the <em>engine failure checklist</em>. Here is
            what you should check and the order in which you should
            check it.</p>

                when pilots switch fuel tanks they accidentally set
                their levers to the <strong>OFF</strong> position. It's also
                possible to accidentally bump the levers with a
                hand or foot, knocking them to the <strong>OFF</strong>
                position or to the position of a fuel tank that's
                empty (like the pilot's head at the time the switch

              <li>Gear creates drag, too. If you have altitude,
              raise the gear. However, if you are at a low
              altitude, you might need to land, so keep them down.
              But you won't glide as far.</li>

            </ol>

            <p>(Note: Since this a multiengine airplane, we would
            normally feather both propellers in an engine failure
            condition. Feathering means pulling the prop levers as
            far aft as possible to limit the drag produced by
            windmilling propellers. We don't discuss propeller
            feathering in this lesson. You can, however, assume
            that I'll feather both propellers in our airborne nest
            for you. In real life, however, you'd have to feather
            your own nest). To learn about feathering propellers,
            see <strong>Flying Twin-Engine Aircraft</strong> in the Learning
            Center.</p>

            <p>The object of the engine failure checklist is to get
            the engine running again. You don't want to make a
            forced landing, unless you're forced to, right? If you
            did manage to get that engine restarted, the only
            problem you now face is explaining to your passengers
            why it suddenly got quiet in the cockpit (and why you
            suddenly started sweating because passengers don't like
            to see these two things occurring together). We'll
            assume that you were unable to restart the engine for
            the purpose of this lesson. (Remember, even though I
            speak of an engine failure in the singular form, I'm
            referring to both engines for the Baron.)</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Being Nosey About the Nose</p>

            <p>As I've already mentioned, completing this checklist
            assumes that you're at a reasonable enough altitude to
            make such a thing practical. Given that it takes just a
            few seconds to run through this checklist, you
            shouldn't lose much altitude during its completion. You
            should, of course, maintain 115 knots while doing it.
            The big question is: should you leave the nose pointing
            in its current direction, or point it somewhere else as
            you complete the checklist?</p>

            <p>Professional thinking holds that safety-conscious
            pilots should always have a safe landing spot in mind
            whenever and wherever they fly. In other words, a good
            pilot is always scouting for a safe landing spot in the
            event of an engine failure the moment he or she lifts
            off. Of course, an airport would always be a preferred
            landing spot because it has runways, mechanics, and
            vending machines. An open field is the next best choice
            if there's no airport nearby (but if has a vending
            machine in the middle of it, please avoid it). Upon
            engine failure, the pilot would instinctively and
            reflexively turn toward the airport or field and run
            through the engine failure checklist. Once the
            checklist is completed, the pilot's full attention can
            now be devoted to landing the airplane. If an engine
            quits at a low altitude, then the pilot must
            immediately dedicate all of his or her attention to
            configuring the airplane for a safe emergency landing
            before completing the engine failure checklist (if
            there is even time to complete it, of course). Engine
            failures after takeoff are a good example of this
            scenario. There's often little or no time to play with
            a checklist when the airplane is just a few hundred
            feet off the ground.</p>

            <p>In this lesson, you'll experience an engine failure
            at 8,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), which puts you
            approximately 7,400 feet above ground level (AGL).
            You'll have plenty of time to complete the engine
            failure checklist in this instance. Once done, you
            should use your GPS (Figure 3-8) to find the nearest
            available airport.</p>

            <p>As you've learned by reading the GPS material in the
            Learning Center, all you have to do is point the tiny
            airplane in the tiny moving map window toward the tiny
            airport to begin moving towards it. This will keep you
            from landing off field, possibly rolling the airplane
            up into a tiny little ball.</p>

            <p>Because of that &quot;psychicness&quot; I mentioned in
            Commercial Lesson 2, I predict that Paine Field will be
            the nearest airport to you. It's great being psychic.
            It's also great being the one who writes these lessons,
            which helps ensure that I'm psychic nearly 100 percent
            of the time. So point your nose toward Paine Field and
            prepare to experience Paine. Let's also prepare for the
            next step in this emergency landing.</p><a name=

            <p>Paine Field has three runways for your landing
            pleasure (Figure 3-9).</p>

            <p>It also has an air traffic control tower. Once
            you're pointed in the direction of the airport, you
            should consider making a &quot;Mayday&quot; call. This is where
            you transmit the words, &quot;Mayday, Mayday, Mayday&quot; on the
            appropriate radio frequency. If you had an engine
            failure in the month of June you wouldn't, however,
            transmit, &quot;Juneday, Juneday, Juneday.&quot; No one would
            understand what you mean, nor would anyone care what
            you mean. &quot;Mayday&quot; is the international term for, &quot;I've
            got an emergency and need assistance.&quot; Obviously, it
            would be best to transmit on Paine Tower's frequency
            since you're having your emergency there. If you didn't
            know the tower frequency, then you should transmit on
            the <em>international aviation emergency frequency</em>
            of 121.5 MHz. You'll certainly get someone's attention
            here. The object is to inform someone of your problem
            and obtain any assistance possible.</p>

            <p>If you did transmit on Paine tower's frequency, the
            controller would most likely ask you about the nature
            of your emergency. You should tell him that both
            engines are inoperative and that you intend to make
            making an emergency landing at Paine. The controller
            would most likely clear the entire airport of traffic
            and make it &quot;Airport Day for Bob&quot; (if Bob is your
            name), meaning that you have the place all to yourself.
            The controller might then ask what kind of assistance
            you'd like. Sometimes they'll offer to roll the crash
            trucks in case you needed that kind of assistance. I
            wouldn't, however, ask them if they could roll the
            catering trucks instead. You want the controller to
            think you're hungry for safety, not sandwiches.</p>

            <p>Landing into the wind is an important objective
            during any emergency. This provides you with the
            slowest touchdown speed and the shortest possible
            landing distance. That's why when communicating with
            Paine tower, the controller would most likely inform
            you of the runway that's most nearly aligned into the
            wind. Pick that one. For this particular lesson, there
            will be no wind at Paine today. (Not only am I psychic,
            I also control the wind. I love this job.) This means
            you have the option of landing on any runway and in any
            direction you choose. Given these choices, I would
            certainly fancy landing on the long runway, which is
            34L/16R. You should fancy that, too. Just don't try and
            fly fancy.</p><a name="The Emergency Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">The Emergency Landing</p>

            <p>Now that you've elected to make your emergency
            landing at Paine Field, let's chat about the technique
            for doing it. Perhaps the single most important item in
            the emergency landing process is to remain within
            gliding distance of the airport. Obviously you'll have
            to circle down from above the airport, eventually
            delivering yourself onto the downwind leg of the runway
            chosen for landing. It's best to avoid making a
            straight-in approach with an engine failure when you
            can fly a modified rectangular traffic pattern (Figure
            3-10)</p>.

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/lesson03_10.gif" alt="" border="0" width=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Why? Flying a rectangular pattern provides you with
            more options for correcting any errors in judgment
            you've made about the airplane's gliding distance. It's
            simply way too difficult to estimate how well you're
            gliding when flying on a long final as compared to
            flying parallel to the runway then turning base and
            final. You can change the geometry of a rectangular
            pattern to reach the runway as shown in Figure 3-11.
            It's much more difficult to change your glide range
            during a long final approach.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            <p>Since you're gliding directly toward the center of
            the airport, begin a left-hand turn using between 20
            and 30 degrees of bank when you're over the center of
            the runway complex. Circling to the left above the
            airport allows you to see it more easily during the
            descent since pilots often sit on the left side of the
            airplane. This is known as a descending spiral. Your
            objective here is to modify the bank angle slightly
            during the descent so as to remain over the geographic
            center of the runway complex. This keeps you in the
            best position from which to choose the most desirable
            landing runway as you get closer to field
            elevation.</p>

            <p>From this point on down, you're constantly watching,
            planning, plotting and scheming.</p>

            <p>When you're approximately within 2,000 feet of
            airport elevation, you should decide on the best runway
            to use for the emergency landing. Since Paine is 606
            feet above sea level, you'll want to make this decision
            when you're approximately 2,600 feet MSL. At this time,
            ask yourself which way you need to maneuver so as to
            roll out on the downwind leg of a suitable landing
            runway. If one runway is favored because of the wind
            conditions, you'll certainly want to maneuver so as to
            rollout flying downwind and parallel to that runway.
            Your objective should be to fly offset from the runway
            centerline by a distance of approximately one quarter
            to one half of a mile (Figure 3-12). This should keep
            you within gliding distance of the desired runway.</p>

            <p>If you planned it properly, you should end up
            midfield, flying downwind at an altitude between 2,000
            and 1,500 feet AGL. Your objective is to end up abeam
            the runway threshold at approximately 1,000 feet AGL
            (Figure 3-13).</p>

            <p>As you've learned in previous lessons, if you're too
            low or high from this position, you can modify the
            shape of the pattern to help you glide to the runway.
            During this portion of the lesson, make sure you use
            the keyboard or hat switch on your joystick to keep an
            eye on the runway's position. Plan on turning onto base
            leg when the runway is 45 degrees to the left of the
            wing if not just a little sooner. As a general rule
            (even if you're not a general), it's always better to
            be a little high than too low when landing without the
            use of the engine. You can always lose altitude but
            it's very difficult to gain altitude when the engine's
            on vacation. From the abeam position downwind, how you
            fly the base and final legs determine whether or not
            you'll be able to glide to the runway. Your ability to
            estimate glide distance and modify your flight path is
            a matter of practice and experience.</p>

            <p>On base leg, however, you're in a good best position
            to complete the <em>emergency landing</em> checklist that
            follows:</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Basic/Emergency Landing
            Checklist</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Airspeed: 115 knots until ready to roundout and
              flare</li>

              <li>Mixtures: Idle cutoff</li>

              <li>Fuel Shutoff Valves: <strong>OFF</strong></li>

              <li>Ignition Switches: <strong>OFF</strong></li>

              <li>Flaps: As Required</li>

              <li>Gear: <strong>Down</strong></li>

              <li>Master Switch: <strong>OFF</strong></li>

              <li>Doors: Unlatch Prior to Touchdown</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Here's a brief explanation of each item
            above:</strong></p>

            <ol>
              <li>You want to maintain 115 knots until you're in a
              position where you don't need the best glide ability
              of the airplane. Most likely this will be when you
              begin the roundout for the landing flare.</li>

              <li>Before landing, the mixtures should be set to
              idle cutoff to prevent leaning fuel or a sudden
              engine restart at a time when you don't expect nor
              want it.</li>

              <li>Fuel shutoff valves should be set to <strong>OFF</strong>
              to prevent fuel leaks after touchdown or impact.</li>

              <li>Ignition switches are set to <strong>OFF</strong> to
              similarly prevent an unanticipated engine restart,
              among other reasons.</li>

              <li>Flaps as required. Remember, if you're landing in
              a field, you'll want to touchdown with full flaps (if
              possible) to reduce your touchdown speed.</li>

              <li>The landing gear should be down before landing
              unless you're landing on water or similar surfaces,
              in which case you may want to make a gear-up landing.
              No, we don't do this to prevent conking a flounder on
              the head. We do so to prevent the airplane from
              nosing forward into the water upon landing, possibly
              resulting in a flip over, much like the dolphin does
              (which you don't want to do since no free snack of
              mackerel is involved).</li>

              <li>The master switch the next to last item that's
              turned off. This minimizes an ignition source that
              could start a post-crash fire. It's last because, on
              airplanes like the Baron, it takes electricity to
              lower the flaps and gear.</li>

              <li>Finally, you want to crack the airplane door
              open. This prevents the door from being jammed if the
              touchdown is rough, meaning that you'll have an
              easier time exiting the airplane if desired.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Because the purpose of this lesson is to train you
            in glide procedures, I'll run through the engine
            failure checklist for you during flight. I want you to
            concentrate on maintaining the proper glide speed and
            remaining within gliding distance of the runway.</p>

            <p>Well, that's the basic course in handling an engine
            failure in flight. I want you to repeat this lessons as
            many times as you need to develop your proficiency.
            Admittedly, it's much more challenging to handle a
            double engine failure in a Baron than it is, say, a
            Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172. The Baron flies a little
            faster and comes down a little quicker. Nevertheless,
            if you can successfully land this airplane at Paine
            Field, you can probably land most any single engine
            airplane under the same conditions, too. The principles
            presented here are generic, but you'll find the
            applicable to most other simulator-type airplanes.</p>
