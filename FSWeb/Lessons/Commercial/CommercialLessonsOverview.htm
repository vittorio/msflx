            Commercial Pilot Certificate
          </div>

          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>Commercial training focuses on advanced flight
            maneuvers. This set of lessons moves you up to a new
            class of aircraft. Operating a complex aircraft and
            more precise flying skills is the theme for this set of
            lessons. Using advanced equipment is important also, so
            becoming familiar with how to operate the GPS is an
            essential skill to bring to these lessons. After
            passing the Flight Simulator Commercial Pilot
            Checkride, you'll be ready to try flying more advanced
            aircraft. That journey begins with these steps:</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Commercial Pilot</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 1: Complex aircraft
            checkout</p>

            <p>Learn to fly with more precision in the Beechcraft
            Baron 58. While this and the other Commercial Pilot
            lessons do not specifically teach multi-engine flying
            skills, they do require you to fly a more complicated
            aircraft. Stepping up from the Cessna 172 to the Baron
            requires you to learn how to control the power and
            propeller (it's not just a throttle any more),
            retractable landing gear, and cowl flaps.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 2: Shortfield takeoff and
            landing</p>

            <p>It takes precise flying to takeoff in the Beechcraft
            Baron 58 from a short runway, clear obstacles at the
            end of the runway, fly a non-standard traffic pattern,
            and land on that same short runway. Here's where you'll
            learn those skills.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 3: Emergency Procedures</p>

            <p>It does not happen often, but engines might fail.
            Developing the skills to handle a complete power loss
            in flight will make you a better pilot. Learn how to
            handle the emergency and get the airplane safely back
            on the ground.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Commercial Pilot solo flights</p>

            <p>Added to practicing emergencies and shortfield
            operations, you'll have the opportunity to practice
            crosswind landings. Extensive ground school material
            precedes the crosswind solo flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Commercial Pilot Checkride</p>

            <p>To earn your Flight Simulator Commercial Pilot
            Certificate, you'll demonstrate for the examiner all of
            the skills learned in the interactive lessons. You will
            not need to demonstrate crosswind landings, but expect
            a full flight in the Baron before you earn the
            certificate.</p>
