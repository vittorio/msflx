            <p>In this lesson, you'll learn to fly a complex
            aircraft, which in this case is an airplane with a
            constant-speed propeller, retractable landing gear, and
            cowl flaps.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>30 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>You should complete all of the Student and Private
            Pilot lessons before beginning this lesson. Reading the
            Ground School material before starting this lesson will
            help you better understand the skills being taught.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>The sky is clear and the wind is calm.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>You'll start on the ground, ready to depart on
            runway 19 at Bremerton National Airport. Your
            instructor will teach you about power operations
            (throttle and propeller RPM), raising and lowering the
            gear, operating cowl flaps, and approach and landing
            procedures in the aircraft. After departing from
            Bremerton, you'll fly to the practice area, work
            through a set of maneuvers, and then return for landing
            on runway 19 at Bremerton.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

              descents and landing approach where airspeed should
              not be less than assigned or more than 10 knots above
              assigned speed.</li>
