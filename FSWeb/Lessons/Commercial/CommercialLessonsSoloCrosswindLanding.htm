            <p>What do a weathervane and a runway have in common?
            The answer is: nothing. While the weathervane points
            into the wind, the runway stays bolted to the earth,
            unmovable, stubborn, and that's all there is to it. The
            problem is that pilots like landing into the wind,
            which allows them to touch down at a slower speed,
            making the airplane easier to control. Pilots also like
            to land on runways, too. Therefore, when the wind blows
            crosswise to the runway, you have little choice but to
            land in this condition (unless you go searching for
            runways that have more favorable winds. This, however,
            isn't too practical). We call this a crosswind landing,
            and you're about to learn a few nifty tips and
            techniques on how it's done.</p>

            <p>First, I'm going to assume that your simulator has
            rudder pedals or your joystick has twisting rudder
            functions. You need these to make crosswind landings.
            If not, I'll assume that you'll use the 0 and ENTER
            keys on the numeric keypad to manipulate the rudder.
            Using your fingers isn't quite the same as using your
            feet, but it will do the job nevertheless. For
            practical purposes, however, I'll just speak in terms
            of rudder pedals for this class.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Crosswind Conundrums</p>

            <p>Learning to land in a crosswind involves only a few
            additional techniques beyond what you've already
            learned. All the essentials for landing should be
            comfortably etched in your brain by now. What we'll do
            is add a few more etchings to make you a complete
            pilot. We'll start with learning how to correct for
            crosswind drift.</p>

            <p>There are two basic methods for correcting for drift
            during a crosswind approach and landing. The first is
            the crab method; the next is the wing-low (or sideslip)
            method. Let's examine how we crab an airplane to
            correct for wind drift; then we'll look at the wing-low
            method for accomplishing the same thing.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Crabbing</p>

            <p>I suspect the term crabbing got its name from the
            observation of crabs as they walk. Crabs seem to point
            in one direction while walking in another. I suspect
            it's just difficult for a crab to walk with all those
            legs at one time. An airplane, however, can be said to
            crab when it points in one direction while heading in
            another. That's why the path your airplane traces over
            the ground is called its ground track.</p>

            <p>If you sit there, fat, dumb, and happy with your
            compass showing a 165-degree heading, you will track a
            165-degree heading over the ground from any given point
            only when there is no wind (or the wind blows directly
            on your nose or tail). A little wind, however, changes
            everything. Think of the wind as being a giant hand.
            Because the airplane doesn't have its feet on the
            ground, it gets pushed around by the wind. Depending on
            how much wind there is and what angle the hand is
            pushing from, the effect can be anywhere from slight to
            considerable.</p>

            <p>The only way to create a straight ground track is to
            compensate for whatever wind there is by pointing the
            airplane's nose (slightly or more so, depending on
            conditions) into the wind (Figure 1).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson11Figure01.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you head the plane to the right a bit and the
            wind pushes to the left a bit, everything balances and
            you make your intended straight line over the
            ground.</p>

            <p>How do you know the precise amount to crab? Make a
            slight coordinated turn (say 5 or 10 degrees at first)
            into the wind, level the wings, and watch the results.
            Keep in mind that I said coordinated turn. We don't
            crab by applying only rudder. We use rudder and aileron
            in coordination to turn into the wind. Don't forget
            this. It's very important.</p>

            <p>If the airplane is crabbed properly, it will make a
            rectangular ground track about the runway, as shown by
            the dashed line in Figure 1. The airplane's ground
            track is now perpendicular to the runway, as flown by
            Airplane A. Similarly, Airplane C is crabbed to the
            left&#8212;into the wind&#8212;to maintain the desired
            ground track while on base leg. Of course, if the wind
            is not directly aligned with the runway, you'll have to
            crab on all five segments of the traffic pattern to
            maintain a rectangular ground track (Figure 2).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson11Figure02.gif" alt="" border=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you let yourself get pushed around by the wind,
            you won't be where you're supposed to be. This is a
            particular problem in the traffic pattern. Other pilots
            and the tower expect you to fly a traffic pattern that
            tracks straight on each leg, and crabbing to take
            account of the wind is the only way to do it.</p>

            <p>Where crabbing becomes especially important is when
            you're lined up with the runway on final approach.
            That's why you want to turn into the wind and establish
            the proper crab angle as soon as possible so that your
            ground track is aligned with the extended runway
            centerline. It may take a few turns to find the proper
            crab angle. That's fine. Just do it.</p>

            <p>Once the crab angle is established, you fly that
            angle all the way to the runway. In fact, you'll flare
            the airplane while still crabbing. It's only when the
            airplane is just about ready to touch down as it flares
            that you do something known as kicking out the
            crab.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Kicking Out the Crab</p>

            <p>No, this has nothing to do with booting a grumpy
            instructor out of the airplane. It has everything to do
            with using sufficient rudder to align the airplane's
            longitudinal axis with the runway centerline before it
            touches down, as shown in Figure 3A.</p>

            <p>Yep, you just add sufficient rudder to straighten
            out the airplane before touching down. That's it. Okay,
            there is just one more thing.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            </table>

            <p>If we assume that you are crabbing to the right,
            then you'll add left rudder to straighten out the
            airplane before touchdown. As you apply left rudder,
            the airplane will want to bank to the left. So you must
            add a tad of right aileron to keep the wings level as
            you kick out the crab, as shown in Figure 3B.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            <p>The crabbing method isn't my preferred method for
            handling crosswind landings. It requires good timing to
            do it properly. To complicate things, as the airplane
            slows down during the flare, you often need to increase
            the crab angle to continue tracking down the runway
            centerline. The reason for this is that the airplane
            slows down during the flare, and a slower airplane
            requires a larger crab angle to compensate for wind
            drift. Therefore, as you flare, you often need to
            increase the crab angle and, just before the wheels
            touch down, you've got to straighten the airplane out
            again. Whew! That's a lot of work. Here's another way
            that's a lot easier on everyone: you, the airplane, and
            your passengers.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">One Wing Low</p>

            <p>To use the wing-low method of crosswind correction,
            all you need to do is bank the airplane in the
            direction of the crosswind. Use the ailerons to do
            this. If the wind is from the right, then add a little
            right aileron. This causes the airplane to slip
            sideways into the wind, as shown in Figure 4. This is
            also why the same method is known as the sideslip
            method of crosswind landing. If you bank sufficiently,
            then the sideways slippage of the airplane will cancel
            out the sideways push of the wind. The result is that
            the airplane tracks down the runway centerline. There
            is one additional thing you must do, however, to make
            this maneuver work.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson11Figure04.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 4</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>As you add sufficient aileron to compensate for the
            wind, the airplane will want to turn in the direction
            of bank. Don't let this happen. Add enough opposite
            rudder to keep the airplane's longitudinal axis aligned
            with the runway centerline. In other words, if you add
            right aileron to lower the right wing and correct for
            the right crosswind, you must also add a little left
            rudder to keep the airplane from turning right. How
            much left (opposite) rudder do you add? Just enough so
            that the airplane's nose points straight down the
            runway. That's it.</p>

            <p>From this position, fly the airplane all the way to
            the runway and begin a normal flare. Don't do anything
            different. As you begin the flare, the right wing will
            be low (right crosswind assumed here), and you'll touch
            down on the right, or upwind, wheel first. This is not
            only normal, it's expected. Airplanes are designed to
            do this while correcting for the crosswind. Of course,
            once you touch down on the upwind wheel, you'll want to
            lower the other wheel to the ground because it's going
            to go down on its own sooner or later. You won't find
            airplanes taxiing on one wheel. If you do, take a
            picture and send it to me. I gotta see this.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Combination Crab and Wing Low</p>

            <p>Do you see the basic difference between the crab and
            the wing-low method of correcting for crosswind? The
            wing-low method is a lot easier and requires a lot less
            skill to perform. It's also a more effective overall
            method for crosswind correction. Nevertheless, I
            combine both methods during crosswind landings.</p>

            <p>I use the crab method while on final approach. Then,
            when I'm about 100 feet above the runway, I transition
            to the wing-low method. This prevents my passengers
            from feeling squished to the side of the airplane
            during a long sideslip.</p>

            <p>There you have it. Crosswind landings aren't that
            tough. They do require practice, and I want you to get
            your share. Practice your crosswind landings in the
            solo session, then meet me back here for the next
            ground school section.</p>
