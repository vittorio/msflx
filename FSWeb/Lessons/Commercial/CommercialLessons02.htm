          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>Years ago, there was a story circulating about a
            pilot who certainly wasn't the sharpest knife in the
            drawer. Supposedly, in the heat of confusion while
            approaching an airport, this guy landed across (or
            perpendicular) to the runway centerline. After a
            massive application of brakes, the bewildered pilot
            came to a stop, looked around and said, &quot;Wow! Look at
            how short this runway is.&quot; Apparently his passenger
            glanced right then left and replied, &quot;Yeah, and look
            how wide the thing is, too.&quot;</p>

            <p>Not all pilots are created equal, nor are all
            airports created equal. Some have runways more than
            10,000 feet in length, while others are stunted at just
            a little more than 1,000 feet long. Some are hard
            surfaced, some are made of grass, some are narrow, and
            some are even wide (but not that wide, thank you). As a
            pilot, you'll need to know how to take off and land on
            the short ones, since the longer ones will seldom pose
            any kind of problem.</p>

            <p>That's what this lesson is about. I plan on showing
            you how to perform something known as a <em>short field
            takeoff</em> and a <em>short field landing</em>. This will
            be done at a little airport in the state of Washington
            known as Cashmere. Cashmere has a short runway that's
            approximately 1,800 feet long. I don't know why it's so
            short...probably because there's just not enough room
            to make it longer.</p>

            <p>Just so you'll have a big picture idea of how this
            lesson will work, here's a quick overview. You'll start
            with the Beechcraft Baron 58 holding in position on the
            very beginning of Runway 7 at Cashmere. Off the end of
            the runway, you'll see many tall trees and some
            mountains (Figure 2-1).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/lesson2figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You may want to put your hands over your eyes just
            to keep from seeing these things, but I'll gently
            remind you that it's difficult to take off without
            using your hands. You'll depart, using short field
            takeoff techniques, fly a left hand traffic pattern
            then return for a short field landing on Runway 7.
            You'll understand why we use short field landing
            techniques when you have a chance to view the
            precipitous terrain along the final approach area
            (Figure 2-2).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>That's the basic idea, so let's get
            started.</p><a name=
            "Short Field Takeoffs and Climbs"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Short Field Takeoffs and Climbs</p>

            <p>Short field takeoffs are normally associated with an
            obstacle or obstacles located off the departure end of
            the runway. This certainly is the situation in
            Cashmere. The runway there is only 1,800 feet long and
            it looks like someone planted quite a few big trees
            along Runway 7's departure path, too. Therefore, you'll
            want to use all of the available runway for departure,
            meaning that we'll start at the very beginning of the
            runway. I've already made this possible by placing you
            right near the threshold for this departure.</p>

            <p>Of course, before any departure, you'd check the
            performance charts for your airplane to ensure that a
            takeoff is actually possible on the chosen runway. I've
            already done this for you. Since you're departing into
            a 15-knot wind, my calculations indicate that the Baron
            needs approximately 1,600 feet of horizontal distance
            to accelerate, lift off, and climb to 50 feet. This is
            enough performance for a departure out of Cashmere,
            given that the temperature is pretty much standard
            today. Since it's not too cold today, you needn't worry
            about wearing your special sweater for departure,
            otherwise known as the <em>Cashmere sweater</em>.</p>

            <p>Once you've completed the takeoff checklist and are
            ready to depart, you'll begin the takeoff by holding
            the brakes and applying full power. No, you don't
            actually try and take off this way. You do this because
            it allows you to develop maximum static rpm before
            beginning the takeoff roll. The net result is that you
            obtain greater acceleration and use less runway during
            the ground roll. Once your rpm is at a maximum, release
            the brakes and keep the airplane along the runway
            centerline.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Best Angle-of-Climb Speed</p>

            <p>Speed is your next concern. The Baron's operating
            reference notes indicate that you should climb at a
            speed known as Vx, or best <em>angle-of-climb</em> speed,
            when making a short field takeoff. Vx is the speed that
            allows the airplane to gain the most altitude for a
            given distance over the ground. If it doesn't cause
            traumatic flashbacks for you, then think back to
            geometry class. The greatest vertical gain in altitude
            for a given horizontal distance means the greatest
            angle of climb as shown in Figure 2-3. The best
            angle-of-climb speed in the Baron is 92 knots.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/lesson2figure03.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you wait until reaching 92 knots before you
            rotate, you'll waste valuable runway space during
            takeoff roll. That's why you
            want to rotate about 5 knots below Vx. As the airplane
            rotates, it is still accelerating, therefore, rotating
            a few knots below Vx allows the airplane to be at Vx
            when the rotation is complete. This maximized the short
            field takeoff efficiency. So plan on rotating at 87
            knots (Figure 2-4) and raise the airplane to a pitch
            attitude that produces a 92 knot climb (Figure 2-5).
            Because of my psychic ability (not <em>psychotic
            debility</em>), I predict that this attitude will be 18
            degrees pitch up. The fact that I've done this a
            billion times really helps with the psychic ability,
            too.</p>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>(As an aside, since this is a multiengine airplane,
            you want to avoid rotating below the single-engine
            minimum controllable speed&#8212;84 knots, the low
            speed red line&#8212;whenever possible. As I mentioned
            in Lesson 1, an engine failure below this speed could
            result in losing control of the airplane.)</p>

            <p>Once you're established in a climb at 92 knots I
            want you to raise the gear (a positive rate of climb is
            assumed here). This will help maximize your climb
            performance.</p>

            <p>OK, there are actually two schools of thought on
            raising the gear during a short field takeoff. One
            school has it that pilots should leave the gear down
            until clearing the obstacle. The concern here is that
            fiddling with the gear handle is difficult for pilots
            who have difficulty handling multiple tasks&#8212;like
            climbing and raising the gear&#8212;on takeoff. The
            other school says that it's best to get the gear up to
            maximize climb performance, despite the fact that it
            places a task burden on the pilot. Because this is
            commercial training, I'm just assuming that you already
            have the skill to avoid being distracted by raising the
            gear handle soon after liftoff. Either way, it's best
            to do what your Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) suggests
            that you should do.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Best Rate-of-Climb Speed</p>

            <p>Once you're off the runway and clear of obstacles in
            your immediate departure path, there's no reason to
            continue climbing at Vx. After all, this attitude
            doesn't allow you to see much over the airplane's nose
            (Figure 2-6).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            </table>

            <p>Considering how formidable those trees looked off
            the end of the runway, not seeing any other trees might
            seem like a good thing. It's not. That's why I want you
            to lower the nose and climb at a new speed called Vy or
            the <em>best rate-of-climb</em> speed.</p>

            <p>Vy is a speed that gives you the most altitude gain
            for a given amount of time. In other words, it's the
            speed that results in the greatest upward deflection in
            the needle of your vertical speed indicator as shown in
            Figure 2-7.</p>

            <p>As a memory aid to help you remember the difference
            between the best <em>angle-of-climb</em> and the <em>best
            rate-of-climb</em> speeds, just ask yourself which
            speed, Vx or Vy, has the most angles associated with
            the letters that make it up. Obviously the &quot;x&quot; has more
            angles than the &quot;y&quot;.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Maneuvering to the Downwind Leg</p>

            <p>Once established at 105 knots climb speed, you'll
            continue your climb to a safe maneuvering altitude of
            2,000 feet MSL, which puts you a little more than 1,000
            feet above ground level at Cashmere (although we used
            500 feet AGL as a safe maneuvering altitude in
            Commercial Lesson 1, we're in mountainous area now.
            Therefore, I prefer using twice that&#8212;1,000 feet
            AGL&#8212;as our safe maneuvering altitude). At 2,000
            feet MSL, you should reduce your manifold pressure and
            rpm to the climb setting of 25 inches and 2,500 rpm. I
            know you won't forget to reduce the manifold pressure
            first before making an rpm reduction (Remember, I'm
            psychic, and I just had a premonition that you won't
            forget this).</p>

            <p>During the first portion of this lesson, if you
            didn't quite clear the trees off the end of the runway,
            I'll gently mention it to you. After all, you're busy
            flying and may not have noticed that you've uprooted a
            Douglas fir and are now dragging around the traffic
            pattern with you. This could prove to be very
            embarrassing for you. The other pilots at the airport
            are sure to think that you prefer a more life-like air
            freshener rather than the little, green, paper-tree
            type that normally hangs from the compass. If you
            knocked over a few trees on takeoff, consider this the
            subtle clue that an improvement in your short field
            technique is in order on a subsequent lesson.</p>

            <p>The traffic pattern altitude (TPA) at Cashmere
            actually is 1,650 feet MSL. Unfortunately, we can't use
            this altitude for training purposes. Because it's
            difficult to divide your attention between the panel
            and your outside view, I need you to use a higher
            traffic pattern altitude of 3,500 feet. There's nothing
            wrong with this, either. Pilots often use higher
            pattern altitudes when flying bigger and faster
            airplanes. So plan on turning your crosswind leg at an
            altitude of 2,500 feet and leveling off at 3,500
            feet.</p>

            <p>Turning crosswind requires turning left to a heading
            of 340 degrees (Figure 2-10). During the turn, I want
            you to limit your bank angle to no more than 20
            degrees. I know I can bank on you to do this. And you
            can take that to the bank.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            </table>

            <p>It's likely that you'll reach TPA on the crosswind
            leg. If you do, I want you to lower the nose and reduce
            power to 19 inches of manifold pressure (Figure 2-11).
            This will keep your airspeed from increasing and
            intimidating all the slower airplanes that may be in
            the pattern. (This is especially important if you're
            dragging that tree around the pattern.)</p>

            <p>Because you're operating in a hilly environment, I
            want you to turn onto the downwind leg before flying
            too far away from the airport. That's why I'll provide
            you with a verbal cue when to turn downwind during this
            lesson. When I do, you'll turn left to a heading of 250
            degrees. Additionally, you want to fly the downwind
            close enough to prevent the hills from obstructing your
            view of the runway.</p>

            <p>As I've previously mentioned, it's always best to
            have the gear extended by the time you're flying
            downwind. This helps prevent the overtaking of slower
            airplanes in the pattern as well as helping ensure that
            you'll land with the gear down. So, as soon as you're
            established on the downwind leg, lower the gear.</p>

            <p>At any time during this lesson you can press 1, 4,
            or 7 on your numeric keypad to look for, or at, the
            runway. (Make sure the <strong>Num Lock</strong> light is
            off.)</p>

            all times.</p>

            <p>Up to this point, you've experienced what it's like
            to make a short field takeoff over an obstacle. Now
            it's time to prepare for the short field landing over
            an obstacle as I have you maneuver to landing on Runway
            7 at Cashmere.</p><a name="Short Field Landings"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Short Field Landings</p>

            <p>Short field approaches and landings are used at
            airports equipped with relatively short landing areas
            or obstacles that may litter the final approach path.
            Given that you are flying a twin-engine airplane that
            requires more runway than most single-engine airplanes,
            you can certainly consider Cashmere airport to be
            worthy of short field landing procedures. The rather
            steep terrain found along the final approach path also
            suggests the use of obstacle clearance procedures on
            final approach.</p>

            <p>As with all landings, you'll want to make sure that
            the landing performance charts indicate that a safe
            landing is possible at any airport before you even
            contemplate doing it yourself. Although this lesson
            doesn't include a discussion of performance charts,
            I've done the calculations for you. Given the 15-knot
            headwind and 1,800 foot runway length, Cashmere, you
            should have no difficulty making a safe landing on
            Runway 7, according to my figures.</p>

            <p>The question is: how do you go about landing on a
            short field and what, if anything, makes these types of
            landings more critical than say landing on a runway of
            normal length? Good question. I'm glad you asked it.
            Perhaps you are psychic, too. If not, then we always
            have an opening for a good sidekick. Let's take the
            last question first.</p>

            <p>Short field landings are accomplished at the slowest
            reasonable approach speed for the particular airplane
            being flown. This assumes, of course, that the airplane
            being flown at this slow speed can actually land safely
            at this airport. Not all airplanes qualify. That's why
            you shouldn't be landing a jet at Cashmere. No matter
            how slow you fly a jet, it's probably still too fast to
            get it safely into airports like this. And even if you
            did mange to get it into Cashmere, it's unlikely you'll
            get it out. You won't have this problem in the Baron
            because you can make an approach at a relatively slow
            airspeed. In your case, the Baron's POH recommends that
            you use a speed of 97 knots with 30 degrees of flaps
            for a short field approach.</p>

            <p>Flying at 97 knots keeps you above the Baron's
            single-engine minimum control speed (just in case one
            of your engines decides to go on vacation). And 97
            knots also allows you to come to a complete stop, with
            the judicious application of brakes, before running out
            of asphalt (which keeps you from being &quot;at-fault&quot; for
            bending an airplane). The only concern is that 97 knots
            also places you at only 30 percent above the airplane's
            stalling speed. That's why you want to use the proper
            landing technique on final. You certainly don't want
            <em>this</em> final to be <em>your</em> &quot;final&quot; final,
            right? What technique should you use to maintain your
            speed and control your glide path? I know you won't
            say, &quot;Ahhh, the technique of letting the instructor
            fly.&quot; Here's a recommendation:</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Navy Pilots Avoid Walking on
            Water</p>

            <p>U.S. Navy pilots are required to be good at making
            short field landings. That's because the field they
            land on is less than 1,000 feet in length. That field
            is called an <em>aircraft carrier</em>. What makes these
            pilots so competent is that the runway they're trying
            to land on is often moving. No, the captain of the ship
            isn't trying to get away from the pilots, either
            (practical jokers though those captains often are). The
            ship moves to generate a headwind for landing,
            resulting in a shorter landing distance for the pilot.
            This is a good thing since a running off the end of
            that particular runway means being run over by the
            airport. That has got to hurt.</p>

            <p>Navy pilots use their elevator to maintain precise
            control of the pitch attitude, and thus their airspeed.
            They use their throttle to control their rate of
            descent. Although you can certainly switch the way you
            use those controls (just as we do when flying an ILS),
            let's use the Navy's technique here. After all, if this
            technique can get a pilot on a boat, it ought to be
            able to get you down at Cashmere without bending any
            part of the airplane.</p>

            <p>Here's how you should fly a short field approach
            beginning from the downwind leg.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flying the Approach</p>

            <p>While on the downwind leg, you should have the gear
            lowered and power reduced to 19 inches of manifold
            pressure. At this point, you should further slow the
            airplane down to 110 knots by initially reducing the
            manifold pressure to 15 inches. Make sure you hold the
            desired TPA of 3,500 feet as you're slowing down. This
            means you may need some nose up trim, so be generous
            with the movement of that trim switch.</p>

            <p>As long as your speed is below 152 knots, you can
            apply the first 15 degrees of flaps, otherwise know as
            the APR or the <em>approach flap</em> setting. You should
            have approach flaps set with an airspeed reading of 110
            knots by the time the runway threshold is 45 degrees to
            the left of the wing. This is the standard runway
            position reference that cues you into when to begin
            your turn to base leg (traffic permitting, of course).
            Feel free to use your numeric keypad, your joystick hat
            switch, or your GPS to identify when the runway
            threshold is 45 degrees to the left of the wing. When
            you're at this reference point, turn left to a heading
            of 160 degrees and fly the base leg (Figures 2-12a and
            2-12b).</p>

            <p>Once you're established on base leg, you should be
            in a position to begin your descent. Start by reducing
            your manifold pressure and configuring the airplane for
            landing by adding full flaps. There are two reasons for
            adding full flaps here. First, this allows you to make
            a relatively steep descent over any obstacles. Second,
            it allows the airplane to safely fly at a slower speed,
            which results in touching down at a slower speed. That
            means you'll be able to stop sooner on the runway,
            which is what this lesson is all about (no, putting the
            right foot in and putting the right foot out isn't what
            it's all about, either).</p>

            <p>When you're in position to do so, you'll turn final
            onto Runway 7. (Feel free to use your keypad, hat
            switch, or GPS to help you determine when to make this
            turn as shown in Figure 2-13).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            </table>

            <p>Once you're established on final approach, you
            should slow the airplane down to 97 knots and trim for
            a stabilized descent. Now you're ready to begin the
            most important part of the short field landing. This is
            the part where you modify your approach path to ensure
            that you clear obstacles (if any) and the airplane
            lands as close to the runway threshold as possible.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Finally, the Final</p>

            <p>When you turn final with the airplane configured for
            landing, you should be at least 500 feet above the
            touchdown area (airport elevation is a satisfactory
            reference here). You'll need at least 500 feet to
            determine the airplane's current glide path, make
            corrections, and estimate whether or not the short
            field landing will be a success. After this
            determination, if your approach didn't look good for
            the home team (this means you), you should go around
            and try it again.</p>

            <p>The objective is to avoid descending too quickly as
            shown in Figure 2-14 or not descending quickly enough,
            as shown in Figure 2-15.</p>

            </table>

            <p>If you descend too quickly, you'll never clear the
            obstacles on final, much less land on the runway. Not
            descending quickly enough results in landing long. This
            is why you turn onto final with at least 500 feet of
            altitude above the touchdown area. Since the short
            field final approach is usually flown with a little bit
            of power, you are now in a perfect position to make
            adjustments to your glide path as necessary to land as
            close to the runway threshold as possible.</p>

            <p>Here's how to estimate if you're descending
            properly: While on final approach, with the pitch
            stabilized to give you 97 knots (meaning you've got the
            airplane trimmed properly), adjust the power to give
            you the desired glide path. If it appears that you'll
            cross any obstacles on final at an excessive altitude,
            resulting in a long landing without sufficient room to
            stop, then reduce power and lower the nose slightly.
            This control movement combination results in an
            increased descent rate while allowing you to maintain
            97 knots. If it appears that you're descending too
            quickly and won't clear the obstacles on final, then
            increase your power and raise the nose slightly. This
            combination should decrease your rate of descent and
            help you maintain 97 knots. It's important to keep in
            mind here that being too low can result in your raising
            the nose and adding power while letting the airspeed
            decay dangerously close to stall speed. You can't let
            this happen. It's actually possible to end up low and
            sufficiently slow that it becomes difficult (if not
            impossible) to power yourself out of such a condition
            to make a safe go-around. Getting too slow means ending
            up on the back side of the power curve. Trust me when I
            say that you don't want to let your airspeed ever
            decrease below 97 knots until you're ready to do the
            roundout and landing flare.</p>

            <p>How do you know if you're on a proper descent path?
            The same principles you learned in earlier landing
            lessons still apply here. Remember, you're using runway
            geometry, peripheral cues (which are hard to identify
            in a simulator) as well as the VASI lights available on
            the runway. Oh, I didn't mention the VASI? Well, it's
            there so use it to help keep you on the proper glide
            path. The particular type of VASI available to you is
            known as a PAPI or Precision Approach Path Indicator
            (Figure 2-16).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Since this is a short field approach, I suggest you
            use the <em>slightly high</em> PAPI light arrangement to
            fly this approach. This should help keep you above the
            obstacles along the final approach.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that this is still a complex airplane
            and you should always do your &quot;GUMP&quot; verbal check on
            final to ensure the airplane is properly configured for
            landing. Landing with the gear up will certainly get
            you points for making the shortest possible landing. It
            won't, however, get you points for keeping the airplane
            in flyable condition.</p>

            <p>It's also important to remember that you're making
            the final approach at a steep angle and close to the
            airplane's stalling speed. As a result, once you're
            clear of any obstacles and ready to begin the roundout
            and flare for landing, you must be careful not to fly
            the airplane right into the ground or stall it onto the
            runway. Since you're close to the stall speed, a
            reduction in power will most likely result in an
            additional speed reduction followed by an increase in
            sink rate. Therefore, when you're ready to roundout and
            flare the airplane, you'll want to reduce power
            gradually and be prepared for a larger rearward
            movement of the elevator control. You certainly don't
            want to reduce power prematurely and flare at too high
            an altitude. This will result in an excessive sinking
            feeling and not only get you onto the runway, but
            possibly <em>into</em> it as well. If the reduction of
            power and the flare results in little or no floating,
            then your approach and airspeed control were excellent.
            Floating during landing is one sign that you had
            excessive airspeed on final.</p>

            <p>If you performed the touchdown correctly, there
            should be little or no floating during the roundout and
            flare. Touchdown should occur near the airplane's stall
            speed with a pitch attitude similar to what you'd
            experience in a typical power-off stall. Upon
            touchdown, you should gently lower the nose and apply
            brakes, all the while increasing back pressure on the
            elevator to prevent the nose gear strut from
            experiencing excessive pressures. The objective is to
            stop the airplane within the shortest distance possible
            without harming the airplane.</p>

            <p>That's the basic idea behind short field landings.
            Of course, if there are no obstacles on final, your
            only objective is to get the airplane on the very
            beginning of the usable landing surface. These types of
            landings don't normally require a steep descent to
            clear obstacles, since there are no obstacles present.
            Practical experience will tell you that the runways are
            often short because obstacles prevent them from being
            longer. Cashmere is a good example. Therefore, where
            you have a short field, there's a good chance that
