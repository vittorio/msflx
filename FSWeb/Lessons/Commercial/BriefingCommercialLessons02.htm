            <p>In this lesson you'll learn to take off and land on
            a short runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>20 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>You should complete all of the Student, Private
            Pilot, and the first Commercial Pilot lessons before
            beginning this lesson. Reading the Ground School
            material before starting this lesson will help you
            better understand the skills being taught.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>The sky is clear and there is a 15 knots wind
            blowing straight down the runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">RECOMMENDED CHARTS</p>

            <p>None</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>In this lesson, you'll begin on the ground, ready
            for takeoff at Cashmere-Dryden airport in Washington.
            After making a short field takeoff on Runway 7, you'll
            fly a left traffic pattern and return to runway 7 for a
            short field landing.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Even though flying a twin-engine
            aircraft should require you to calculate the safe
            distance for takeoff if an engine fails during your
            departure, you can operate this aircraft on this flight
            with the assurance that both engines will operate
            normally.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>F7</strong> to operate flaps<br>
            <strong>G</strong> key to operate landing gear<br>
            <strong>Shift + 3</strong> to display the GPS<br>
            <strong>Shift + 4</strong> to display the throttle quadrant</p>

            <p class="SubHead">FLIGHT CRITERIA</p>

            <p>You'll be asked to maintain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Airspeed within 10 knots as assigned except on
              takeoff, where you need to hold a precise airspeed
              assignment within 3 knots, and on approach to landing
              where you need to remain within 5 knots of the
              97-knot approach speed.</li>

              <li>Altitude within 100 feet as assigned.</li>

              <li>Headings within 10 degrees as assigned</li>

              <li>Bank within 10 degrees as assigned</li>
