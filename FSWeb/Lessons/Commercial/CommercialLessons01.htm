            <p>Congratulations on completing the student and
            instrument private pilot lessons. You've come this far
            and you should feel quite proud of yourself. I'm
            certainly proud of you. Now it's time to make another
            big jump in your aviation education. The three
            commercial lessons and solo session in this series will
            help prepare you to operate heavy machinery. No, I
            don't mean bulldozers, backhoes, and street cleaners; I
            mean an airplane like the twin-engine Beechcraft Baron
            58.</p>

            <p>Whether or not you know it, I have big plans for
            you. That's why I picked the Beechcraft Baron 58 for
            your commercial training. I eventually see you flying
            heavy metal, and I don't mean rock bands, either.
            Without having to consult a psychic, I think there is a
            Boeing 737&#8211;800 in your future. That's the heavy
            metal of which I speak. If one of these airplanes is in
            your stars (or possibly your airport garage), then it's
            best that you know how to operate an airplane with
            complexity somewhere between that of a Cessna Skyhawk
            SP Model 172 and the Boeing 737. That's why I won't put
            you directly into a Boeing 737 for your commercial
            training. If I did, you'd probably spend all your time
            saying things like, &quot;Yeee haaa!, hold on little doggie,
            whoooa boy, whoooa boy, somebody stop me!&quot; You get the
            point, right? It's just too big a jump without first
            taking an intermediate form of training.</p>

            <p>There's one thing, however, that won't happen with
            the commercial training in the Baron. Because of the
            difficulties involved, we won't be practicing any
            single-engine operations in this multiengine airplane.
            If you want to fly on a single engine, I have a Skyhawk
            SP ready and warmed up for you. It's true, however,
            that the most important thing about learning to fly a
            multiengine airplane is dealing with the loss of one
            engine. (By that I mean one engine stops running at a
            very critical time, not that we actually lose an engine
            like we do with a set of car keys.) Anyone who flies an
            actual multiengine airplane is sure to practice
            single-engine operations. For our purposes, we'll
            assume that both engines on the Baron operate at the
            same time, all the time, which is how it works in real
            life 99.999999 percent of the time. That's why we won't
            be discussing things like single-engine minimum control
            speed, also known as Vmc, as well as Vsse, Vyse, and so
            on. As a benefit, all the material discussed in this
            lesson is applicable to the operation of any complex
            single-engine airplane, too. If you want to learn more
            about engine-out procedures in twin-engine aircraft,
            see <strong>Flying Twin-Engine Aircraft</strong> in the Learning
            Center.</p>

            <p>I do feel obligated to offer one more note for those
            who actually fly the Baron outside of Flight Simulator:
            I've had to modify the operating procedures slightly to
            make these lessons work. That's why you should always
            check the actual airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook
            for the specific procedures applicable to the airplane
            you fly. And whatever you do, don't run with a pair of
            scissors in your hand or jump into a swimming pool
            until an hour after you've eaten. You get the point,
            right?</p>

            <p>And so we begin.</p><a name=
            "Complex Airplane: The Big Picture"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Complex Airplane: The Big
            Picture</p>

            <p>First, here's an easy question. Why do they call
            them the Canary Islands? Good, you got that one. Now,
            why do we call the Beechcraft Baron a complex airplane?
            If you've never been in one, the Baron can appear quite
            complex, especially if the only airplane you've flown
            is the Skyhawk SP.</p>

            <p>Complex airplanes always have three things in
            common: flaps, retractable gear, and a controllable
            propeller. You're already familiar with flaps since you
            used them on the Skyhawk SP. Before we begin our
            in-depth study of the Baron, let's take a quick look at
            its instrument panel to make sure we know what we're
            looking at.</p>

            <p>Figure 1-1 is a picture of the Baron's instrument
            panel with its major instruments identified below.
            Study this carefully and familiarize yourself with
            these instruments. Once done, you can begin your
            lesson.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Retractable Landing Gear</p>

            <p>Long ago, someone decided that retracting the
            airplane's gear would reduce drag and allow the
            airplane to fly faster. Not only does this work in
            theory, it also works in practice. Airplanes can fly,
            climb, and descend at a faster speed with the gear
            retracted. These same airplanes can also slow down
            faster when the gear is extended. Pilots often use
            landing gear drag to their advantage to help them get
            the airplane down quicker when they are in the vicinity
            of the airport in preparation for landing. Although
            there are a few important items to remember about
            operating the gear, nothing is more important than
            remembering to put it down before landing. You don't
            want to land your airplane with the gear retracted.
            You'll know if you did because it will take full power
            to taxi the airplane. Just kidding, but you get the
            point, right?</p>

            <p>Figure 1-2 shows the Baron's gear handle next to
            three green lights, each representing one of the three
            landing gear struts. The center green light represents
            the nose gear; the two green lights on either side
            represent the right and left main gear. After takeoff,
            once the VSI shows a positive rate of climb, you should
            raise the gear handle to retract the gear. At this
            point, you'll want to check to make sure that all three
            green lights go out, indicating that each gear has
            retracted (Figure 1-3).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/lesson1figure03.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>

            </table>

            <p>It's a good procedure to say &quot;Gear up and locked&quot;
            after raising the gear handle and all three gear lights
            show proper gear retraction. If the gear failed to
            retract (or extend, for that matter) the <strong>gear in
            transition</strong> light might remain illuminated.
            Sometimes, albeit rarely, this does happen. While
            mechanical equipment is reliable, it's not completely
            reliable. That's why, as I write this, I keep two
            computer repair kits handy in case a circuit board goes
            haywire. If one or more of the gears didn't retract,
            then, as the astronauts say, &quot;Houston, we have a
            problem.&quot; You'd want to lower the gear handle and
            return for landing to have your machine checked out by
            a qualified mechanic.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, landing gear is very reliable. In fact,
            whenever there is a problem with the gear it's usually
            pilot induced. For instance, you shouldn't lower the
            gear while flying at speeds above 152 knots. Doing so
            exposes the gear doors to extreme stress, possibly
            causing them to leave the airplane. This isn't good,
            even if you don't own the airplane. So make sure you
            slow the airplane down to 152 knots or less before you
            lower the gear.</p>

            <p>If you're in cruise flight zipping through the air
            at 170 knots indicated airspeed, you'll have to reduce
            power to slow the airplane down. In an actual airplane,
            you wouldn't want to yank the throttle back to idle to
            do this, either. Yanking a throttle is never a good
            idea in an airplane. Doing so, according to many
            experts, could shock-cool the engine. Think of this as
            installing a large glacier under your engine cowling
            when it's at its peak operating temperatures. Making
            this behavior a habit might result in long term engine
            damage. That, my friend, is no good. (It's also why in
            the very next section I'll talk about how to use
            something known as cowl flaps to keep your engine from
            overcooling and overheating. Stay tuned, future power
            plant master.)</p>

            <p>So, plan in advance and gradually reduce power to
            slow the airplane down before lowering the gear. In
            case you're wondering, the professionals try and reduce
            power no more than one inch of manifold pressure per
            minute (you'll learn about manifold pressure
            shortly).</p>

            <p>One last thing about landing gear operations. As
            I've already mentioned, you must remember to put it
            down before you land. If you don't, then you won't need
            your landing light to see the runway at night. The
            sparks from the airplane's metal belly will light the
            runway for you.</p>

            <p>While most airplanes have a warning horn (or a
            warning instructor) to remind you to put the gear down
            before you land, I like to count proper planning to
            accomplish this objective. That's why you'll always use
            the acronym GUMP before every landing.</p>

                  more about this later).</p>

            </table>

            <p>I always say &quot;GUMP&quot; at least four times before I
            land any retractable-geared airplane to remind me to
            put the gear down. You should, too. But don't
            mispronounce this: It sounds a lot like like &quot;jump,&quot;
            and you don't want your passengers to do that.</p>

            <p>I say GUMP on the downwind leg (the gear should be
            down by then), on base leg, on final and when I cross
            the threshold. Am I paranoid about leaving the gear up?
            Maybe I am. But since when is this type of paranoia
            such a bad thing?</p>

            <p>Now that you know about operating the landing gear,
            it's a good time to talk about what you can do to keep
            the engine from getting too cool or too
            hot.</p><a name="Keeping Your Cool with Cowl Flaps"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Keeping Your Cool with Cowl
            Flaps</p>

            <p>By now you've probably guessed that our powerplant
            (the engine) is also a heat plant. All that local
            motion results in the production of calories galore,
            with every bit of the heat looking for a home. One of
            the things you must be aware of in a complex airplane
            is preventing engine overheating when operating at high
            power settings. Unfortunately, engine cooling is least
            effective at high power settings and low airspeeds,
            where a limited amount of air enters the engine
            cowling. This condition just happens to describe our
            airplane during a climb, doesn't it?</p>

            <p>While overheating is damaging, excessive cooling can
            also shorten engine life, as I've already discussed.
            Long or rapid descents under low power conditions might
            cause shock cooling of the engine, a condition in which
            the various metals of the cylinders cool suddenly and
            at different rates. This can lead to something getting
            bent out of shape. That can lead to buying expensive
            new engine parts in an actual airplane, so pilots
            generally have a strong imperative to avoid doing
            it.</p>

            <p>In addition to properly planning your descents,
            there's something else you can do to help keep the
            engine from getting too hot during a climb and too cold
            during cruise and during descents. I'm referring to
            using something known as the cowl flaps (Figure
            1-4).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

              </tr>

            <p>Just to be clear here, I said <em>cowl</em> flaps, not
            <em>cow</em> flaps. The airplane doesn't have anything
            associated with a cow on it, not even the &quot;rrrrr-udder&quot;
            pedals. (Sorry, I had to do that.)</p>

            <p>Cowl flaps are moveable sections of metal under the
            engine cowling (thus the origin of the phrase &quot;cowl&quot;
            flaps) that can be manually opened or closed from the
            cockpit. All the pilot needs do is move a small lever
            (Figure 1-5).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Keeping the cowl flaps closed (Figure 1-6) helps
            restrict the flow of air over the engine and through
            the cowling. This helps maintain warmer engine
            temperatures during cruise flight as well as during a
            descent. Opening the cowl flaps before takeoff and
            during climbs allows more air to flow over the engine
            and through the cowling, which helps prevent engine
            overheating.</p>

            <p>Of course not all airplanes have cowl flaps. These
            are usually found on airplanes with larger engines,
            typically having 200 horsepower or more, like the
            Baron.</p>

            <p>Your job will be to ensure that the cowl flaps are
            always open for takeoff and climbs, and always closed
            for cruise and descents. In real life, like a lizard
            eyeing a juicy, tasty-looking fly, we'd carefully
            monitor our cylinder head temperatures (CHT) and oil
            temperatures to keep these temperature values in the
            green. I guess this means we'd act just like a monitor
            lizard, except we'd be doing the fly(ing) instead of
            eating one (don't mind me, I just like my job).</p>

            <p>At this point, you've had your hands full with gear
            handles and cowl flap levers, neither of which have
            much to do with operating the engine. So let me put a
            little spin on this lesson by introducing you to the
            propeller. Then I'll help you get a grip on the
            throttle control. These two items are a little
            different from what you've experienced when flying the
            Shyhawk SP, but I know you'll find them
            interesting.</p><a name=
            "The Big Spin on the Propeller"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Big Spin on the Propeller</p>

            <p>Propellers come in all sizes and colors, but they
            are of two basic types: fixed-pitch and constant speed.
            In an airplane with a fixed-pitch prop (like the one of
            the Skyhawk SP you've flown), one lever&#8212;the
            throttle&#8212;controls both power and propeller rpm.
            The Baron, however, has what is known as a
            <em>constant-speed propeller</em>, which means there are
            separate controls for engine power and propeller
            rpm.</p>

            <p>The Skyhawk SP's fixed-pitch propeller had its pitch
            (angle of attack) fixed or made permanent during the
            forging process. The angle is set in stone (actually,
            set in aluminum). This pitch can't be changed except by
            replacing the propeller, which pretty much prevents you
            from changing the propeller's pitch in flight.
            Fixed-pitch props are not ideal for any single thing,
            yet they are, in many ways, best for everything. They
            represent a compromise between a propeller blade's best
            angle of attack for climb and its best angle for
            cruise. Fixed-pitch propellers are simple to operate,
            and easier (thus less expensive) to maintain.</p>

            <p>As I've already mentioned, on fixed-pitch propeller
            airplanes like the Skyhawk SP, engine power and engine
            rpm are both controlled by the throttle. One lever does
            it all, power equals rpm, and that's that. Complex
            airplanes, however, have something known as a
            <em>constant-speed</em> (or, controllable-pitch)
            propellers.</p>

            <p>Airplanes with these propellers usually have both a
            throttle and a propeller control, so you manage engine
            power and propeller rpm separately as shown in Figure
            1-7. (Since you may want to fly a single-engine complex
            airplane at some point, the figures shown here
            represent a single-engine complex airplane, despite the
            fact that you're flying a Baron. So, just double
            everything I say&#8212;except the jokes&#8212;to make
            the material applicable to the Baron).</p>

            <p>On airplanes with constant-speed propellers,
            movement of the throttle determines the amount of fuel
            and air reaching the cylinders. Simply stated, the
            throttle determines how much power the engine can
            develop. Movement of the propeller control changes the
            propeller's pitch (its angle of attack); which directly
            controls how fast the propeller rotates (its speed or
            rpm) as shown in Figure 1-8.</p>

            pitch determines how efficiently that power is used.
            Let's examine how the controllable propeller works.
            Then we'll examine why changing the propeller's pitch
            in the Baron is such a helpful thing.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Propeller Control Goal</p>

            <p>Forward movement of the propeller control causes
            both halves of the propeller to rotate about their axes
            and attack the wind at a smaller angle (i.e., take a
            smaller bite of air) as shown in Figure 1-9.</p>

            <p>From our earlier discussion on aerodynamics, you
            know that a smaller angle of attack means less drag and
            less resistance to forward motion; therefore, moving
            the propeller control forward increases propeller rpm.
            Pulling the propeller control rearward causes the
            propeller to attack the wind at a larger angle of
            attack (that is, take a larger bite of air). Propeller
            drag increases and engine rpm slows as shown in Figure
            1-10.</p>

            four cycle airplane engine.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Getting Your Strokes Right</p>

            <p>Airplane engines have four cycles: intake,
            compression, power, and exhaust.</p>

            <p>The <em>intake cycle</em> is what's important here
            (Figure 1-12, position A). This cycle occurs as the
            piston moves downward and the intake value opens. Since
            the cylinder was filled with the piston as the cycle
            started, moving the piston downward creates a vacuum.
            Think of a vacuum as the presence of nothing, or the
            absence of everything (your choice). Nature abhors a
            vacuum (that's &quot;vacuum,&quot; not &quot;vacuum cleaner,&quot; so this
            isn't a reason for not cleaning your house). You've
            heard that fools rush in where angels fear to tread?
            While the piston is in its downward journey, a mixture
            of fuel and air rushes into the cylinder (Figure 1-12,
            position A). This sucking action is responsible for the
            term <em>manifold pressure</em>. It's the sucking action
            of the descending piston that creates a vacuum in the
            induction system (Figure 1-13).</p>

            <p>With the throttle closed, the throttle valve in the
            induction system prevents air (and thus fuel) from
            rushing into the cylinders and powering the engine. But
            what is it that forces air into the induction system in
            the first place? Yes, it's the pressure of the
            surrounding atmosphere. Because atmospheric pressure is
            higher than the pressure within the induction system,
            air flows into the cylinders. Simply stated, the
            atmosphere wants to push air into the induction system
            (toward the suction created by the downward moving
            pistons). The amount of this push is measured by the
            manifold pressure gauge (which is nothing more than a
            barometric measuring device calibrated to read pressure
            in inches of mercury&#8212;just like altimeters).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Pressure is On</p>

            <p>Manifold pressure is measured downstream of the
            throttle valve as shown in Figure 1-13. When the
            throttle is closed, air outside the engine (under
            higher atmospheric pressure) can't flow into the
            induction system, despite the vacuum on the engine side
            of the throttle valve. Figure 1-14 shows a manifold
            pressure of 14 inches of mercury with a closed
            throttle. The engine is sucking as hard as it can but
            the outside air can't get past the closed throttle
            valve.</p>

            throttle fully (Figure 1-16), the pressure downstream
            of the throttle valve approaches that of the
            atmosphere. In other words, the air is being forced

            <p>As a measurement of the atmosphere's weight, we say
            that the outside air pressure is 30 inches of mercury.
            Therefore, the engine's manifold pressure at full
            throttle is a little less than 30 inches (it's a little
            less because of air friction and intake restrictions
            within the induction system). Clearly, then, manifold
            pressures near 30 inches of mercury signifies more
            power is being developed by the engine. On the other
            hand, low manifold pressures (say 15 inches or so)
            indicate less fuel and air is entering the cylinders
            and less power is being produced.</p>

            <p>As the airplane climbs, you'll notice the manifold
            pressure decreases even though the throttle is fully
            opened. Why? Atmospheric pressure decreases as you
            ascend. It decreases approximately one inch of mercury
            for every thousand feet of altitude gain as shown in
            Figure 1-18 (and increases approximately one inch of
            mercury for every thousand feet of altitude loss).</p>

            <p>I mentioned that engine power is controlled by the
            throttle. That's basically true; but engine power can
            also be varied slightly by the rpm you've selected. In
            other words, the total power produced by the engine is
            really a combination of both manifold pressure and
            engine rpm. Think of it this way: you're on a 2,000
            calorie diet. You can eat 1,500 calories for breakfast,
            500 for lunch and skip dinner; 1,000 for breakfast, and
            500 each for lunch and dinner, and so forth. There are
            lots of combinations that will yield 2,000
            calories.</p>

            <p>The same is true on a constant-speed prop plane.
            Different combinations of manifold pressure and engine
            (prop blade) rpm can be used to attain a given power
            setting. Figure 1-20 shows how this works for the

            propeller control selects engine rpm.</p>

            <p>Why would you want so many combinations of manifold
            pressure and rpm? The reason is that fuel consumption,
            airspeed and the percent of power produced all vary
            based on different combinations of manifold pressure
            and rpm. Noise levels and smoothness of engine
            operation also vary based on rpm. Even some of your

            combinations for power selection.</p>

            change its pitch in flight in the first place?&quot; After
            all, this is just another airplane knob you have to

            <p>Airplanes equipped with constant-speed propellers
            are much more versatile in their operation. For
            instance, fixed-pitch propeller airplanes have their
            propellers permanently configured (pitched) for either
            a fast cruise, a fast climb, or somewhere in between
            (like the Skyhawk SP). You can't change their pitch in
            flight. Airplanes with controllable-pitch propellers,
            however, can essentially reshape the prop, by changing
            its pitch, from the cockpit. This means you can obtain
            the optimum angle of attack for climb or cruise. Let's
            take a look at how a different pitch may result in
            increased performance. (As a reminder, while I'm only
            referring to the operations of a single engine in this
            lesson, this obviously applies to operating both
            engines in the Baron.)</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Low Pitch and High rpms</p>

            <p>When climbing a very steep hill in a car, you want
            your automobile's engine to develop nearly 100 percent
            of its maximum power; that's why you start off in low
            gear. Low gear results in high engine rpm, thus more
            engine power being transferred to the wheels (Figure
            1-21, position A). As a result, your car is less likely
            to bog down during the climb. Pay attention the next
            time you walk up a steep hill. You'll find yourself
            using lots of short steps (high rpm) instead of the
            long strides you'll use on the flatlands.</p>

            <p>The same philosophy applies to airplanes. During a
            climb, we want the airplane's engine to develop maximum
            power. This allows maximum thrust to be produced
            (remember, it's excess thrust that allows an airplane
            to climb).</p>

            <p>Engine power is dependent on its rpm. For an engine
            to develop its maximum power, it must be operated at
            its highest allowable rpm. At any lower rpm the engine
            develops only a fraction of its total horsepower.
            That's why on takeoff (or during go-arounds) we want
            the propeller set to its lowest pitch (highest rpm)
            position (full forward on the prop lever). In this
            position the propeller experiences less wind
            resistance, resulting in less drag and higher engine
            rpms (Figure 1-21, position B). Under these conditions
            the engine develops maximum power, thus maximum thrust
            for climbing and accelerating.</p>

            <p>You may be thinking, &quot;How can the propeller deliver
            maximum thrust if it doesn't take a big bite of air?&quot;
            Think of it this way: If the propeller does take a big
            bite of air (a large angle of attack), it will surely
            develop more thrust&#8212;but only if the propeller
            continues to turn over at a high speed. That's the
            problem! Taking such a large bite of air increases the
            propeller's drag (just like a wing at a large angle of
            attack). This disproportionally decreases the
            propeller's speed and prevents the engine from
            developing its maximum horsepower (it bogs it down,
            like the car). The final result is that the propeller
            produces less thrust than it's capable of
            producing.</p>

            <p>One last way of conceptualizing this is to think
            about a blender. (If you don't have one, simply send
            out a few wedding invitations). If hard vegetable fiber
            is dropped in before the blades have a chance to spin
            up, the machine bogs down (rpms stay low). Nothing gets
            chopped because the motor has less spinning force or
            torque at slower speeds. However, once the blender's
            blades spin to a fast speed, nothing seems to resist
            the spinning force of the blades. High motor rpms mean
            maximum power is developed and the blender's blades
            resist slowing when they encounter thick vegetable
            fiber. The net result of higher engine rpms for the
            airplane is that maximum engine thrust is produced when
            the propeller spins faster, even though the blades are
            at a lower pitch.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">High Pitch and Low rpms</p>

            <p>Are there times when you don't need to develop
            maximum engine power? Yes. For example, if you're on
            the freeway, your automobile only needs enough power to
            keep it moving at a reasonable speed&#8212;perhaps only
            55 percent to 65 percent of its maximum power. High
            gear (low engine rpm) is selected to maintain freeway
            speeds (Figure 1-22, position A). High gear means the
            engine turns over at a lower rpm, thus producing only
            the horsepower needed to keep the car moving along at
            an acceptable pace. This is achieved with less fuel
            consumption than if the car were running flat out.</p>

            <p>Airplanes are operated in a similar manner during
            cruise flight (Figure 1-22, position B). There is no
            need to develop maximum horsepower during cruise
            flight. Our concern is to obtain a reasonably fast
            airspeed while keeping the fuel consumption low. After
            all, we could operate our Baron in cruise flight at
            full throttle&#8212;but why? The larger drag associated
            with higher speeds would consume enormous amounts of
            fuel and not allow us to move all that much faster
            anyway (remember, total drag increases dramatically at
            higher airspeeds). Therefore, cruise flight is a
            tradeoff between high airspeed and low fuel
            consumption.</p>

            <p>With the proper combination of manifold pressure and
            engine rpm, you can obtain a reasonably fast airspeed
            for a given rate of fuel consumption (See Figure 1-20
            for a few of these combinations). In cruise flight we
            select the desired manifold pressure with the throttle,
            and engine rpm with the propeller control. Now the
            propeller produces a specific amount of lift (thrust)
            for a given (lower) fuel consumption.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Why Constant-Speed Propellers?</p>

            <p>Controllable-pitch propellers on complex airplanes
            are of the <em>constant-speed</em> variety. Once the rpm
            is established, changes in manifold pressure (by moving
            the throttle) won't affect engine speed. In other
            words, opening (Figure 1-23) or closing (Figure 1-24)
            the throttle (or changing the airplane's attitude)
            doesn't vary the engine's rpm. This is why these
            controllable propellers are given the name
            constant-speed propellers. (Of course, if you pull the
            throttle all the way back, there's simply no power
            available to keep the propeller spinning. The engine's
            rpm has no choice but to drop.)</p>

            <p>The reason constant-speed propellers are put on an
            airplane is to reduce a pilot's workload. Instead of
            having to readjust the rpm with every change in power,
            you simply set the rpm and it stays where it's
            put&#8212;just like your home thermostat keeps the
            temperature constant (although the thermostat in my
            home only has two settings: Cold and Kenya).</p>

            <p>What is the value of having a propeller that
            maintains a preset (constant) speed? It provides you
            with one less item to readjust while managing power.
            Let's suppose the airplane's Pilot Operating Handbook
            suggests the most efficient use of engine power during
            climb occurs at 25 inches of manifold pressure and
            2,500 rpm (pilots refer to this as 25 squared, which
            proves how weak some of them are in math). As you
            climb, the manifold pressure decreases approximately
            one inch per thousand feet (because the outside air
            pressure decreases one inch for every thousand feet
            altitude gain). Since you have a constant speed
            propeller, the rpm automatically stays set at 2,500,
            despite variations in manifold pressure (or throttle
            positions). All you need to do is keep adding throttle
            to maintain the desired manifold pressure during the
            climb; the rpm needs no adjusting.</p>

            <p>In the Baron, all takeoffs will be made with full
            throttle (approximately 29 inches of manifold pressure)
            and propeller controls full forward, which will produce
            approximately 2,700 rpm. This is called <em>takeoff
            power</em> and we can be assured of obtaining maximum
            thrust in this condition. Once the airplane reaches a
            safe maneuvering altitude, however, we'll want to
            reduce power to the climb power setting of 25 inches of
            manifold pressure and 2,500 rpm. This prevents the
            engine for working too hard, possibly overheating and
            damaging itself. You can consider an altitude of 500
            feet AGL a safe maneuvering altitude (unless I
            recommend a higher altitude in any lesson, which I
            might do). Why 500 feet? There's one school of thought
            that the first reduction of power after takeoff changes
            the engine's stress level, possibly exacerbating an
            already existing engine problem, thus instigating an
            engine failure. Therefore, it seems reasonable not to
            adjust power until reaching an altitude at which you
            can more easily maneuver the airplane and return for
            landing.</p>

            <p>In cruise flight, we'll use manifold pressure
            settings around 19 to 23 inches and rpm values of
            around 2,300, depending on what the lesson specifics
            call for.</p><a name="Making Power Changes"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Making Power Changes</p>

            <p>With the ability to vary propeller pitch you need to
            understand a few very important principles about power
            management. It's relatively easy to overstress an
            engine if the throttle and propeller controls aren't
            used in the proper order during power changes. I can't
            overstress this point.</p>

            <p>For instance, suppose your manifold pressure and rpm
            are set at 23 inches and 2,300 rpm (Figure 1-25).</p>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Now suppose that you want to increase the manifold
            pressure and rpm to 25 inches and 2,500 rpm. If you
            increase the manifold pressure to 25 inches first, it
            will increase the combustible mixture flowing to the
            cylinders. This would normally spin the propeller
            faster. Yet this doesn't happen, since the propeller
            takes a bigger bite of air to absorb the increase in
            power, thus maintaining its last established rpm.
            Cylinder stress increases as the propeller keeps the
            rpm from increasing (that is, the expanding gases push
            harder, yet are unable to move the pistons faster).
            Given enough cylinder stress, you could damage the
            engine.</p>

            <p>When you want to increase both the manifold pressure
            and rpm, increase the rpm first, then increase the
            manifold pressure. In other words, move the propeller
            control forward first, the throttle next.</p>

            <p>Follow the same philosophy when decreasing manifold
            pressure and rpm. Pull the throttle back first,
            followed by the propeller control, as shown in Figure
            1-26. Another way of thinking about this is to keep the
            propeller control lever physically ahead of the
            throttle during all manifold pressure and rpm changes.
            A memory aid for this is to <em>keep the prop on top</em>
            (or always in front of the throttle).</p>

            <p>Be aware that the propeller governor starts working
            only when the engine is operating above a specific rpm
            and not below. In other words, moving the throttle will
            change the rpm until the propeller reaches its minimum
            governing rpm.</p>

            <p>Now you're ready to understand the &quot;P&quot; portion of
            the GUMP acronym we spoke of earlier. GUMP, as you
            recall, stands for: <strong>G</strong>as (fuel pump on),
            <strong>U</strong>ndercarriage (gear down), <strong>M</strong>ixture (full
            in) and <strong>P</strong>rop (propeller control full forward).
            Why is the propeller control put in the full-forward
            (low pitch&#8212;high rpm) position just before
            landing? It's done to prepare for the unlikely event
            there's a need to go-around. A <em>go-around</em> is an
            aborted landing that follows these steps: you apply
            full power, climb out, and go around for another
            attempt at landing. In this situation, it's important
            that the engine develop full power&#8212;just like on
            takeoff. That's why the propeller control is moved to
            the full-forward position before landing&#8212;exactly
            where it is during takeoff.</p>

            <p>You now know the basics of what makes an airplane
            engine tick, kick, heat, and freeze. You don't,

            now you at least have some vital information under your
            seatbelt&#8212;information that can help you fly safely
            and economically.</p>

            <p>Here are just a few more tips you'll need to fly the
            Baron and other airplanes like it.</p><a name=
            "It's Fast, So Fly It Fast"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">It's Fast, So Fly It Fast</p>

            <p>The Baron, like many complex airplanes, is a fast
            airplane. To make the most of its speed, I want you to
            fly the airplane fast when and where it's appropriate.
            For instance, when you're descending to land at an
            airport, it doesn't make sense to descend at the same
            speed you'd use to fly your final approach to landing.
            You can descend up to speeds reaching 223 knots if you
            desire. This is the <em>maximum operating speed</em> of
            the Baron, also known as its high speed red line on the
            airspeed indicator. Of course, I'm not a big fan of
            operating near red line but it can legally be done (but
            I still don't recommend it).</p>

            <p>The yellow arc on the Baron's airspeed indicator
            begins at 195 knots and extends to 223 knots, or red
            line. This is called the <em>caution range</em> and you
            should only be operating in this airspeed range if the
            air is perfectly smooth. Thus, the need to use caution.
            If the air is smooth, however, feel free to operate
            within this speed range. There's absolutely nothing
            wrong doing so. This certainly works to your advantage
            when you're descending to land at an airport and need
            to get down from cruise altitude. Descending at these
            higher speeds produces a lot of drag, allowing the
            airplane to descend quickly.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, you can't come screaming into the
            airport environment at 220 knots without scattering all
            the other airplanes in the traffic pattern like bowling
            pins. That's why it's always best to enter the traffic
            pattern with your gear down. Since the maximum speed at
            which you can lower the gear is 152 knots, you'll have
            to slow the airplane down to at least this speed before
            entering the pattern. Once the gear is down, however,
            you can't just increase your speed back to 220 knots.
            That's because 152 knots is also the maximum
            gear-extended speed. In other words, because of either
            the structure of the gear or the gear doors, you
            shouldn't fly faster than 152 knots with the gear
            lowered. When you fly this lesson, you'll see how
            quickly the airplane descends with the gear lowered.
            Therefore, once the gear is down, if you need to lose a
            lot of altitude quickly, you'll be able to do so very
            quickly by increase your speed up to but not beyond 152
            knots.</p><a name="A Few Final Pointers"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">A Few Final Pointers</p>

            <p>Here are a few final pointers that I want you to
            consider when flying the Baron:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The Baron is a multiengine airplane and, like
              most similar airplanes, it has something known as Vmc
              or single-engine minimum control speed. This is the
              low-speed red line on the airspeed indicator (Figure
              1-27) set at 85 knots. Although we won't go into
              detail on Vmc in this lesson, let it be said that we
              avoid rotating a multiengine airplane below its Vmc
              because the airplane would most likely become
              uncontrollable if an engine was lost (or even
              sputtered) below this speed.</li>

              <li>The blue line, at 101 knots on the airspeed
              indicator, indicates the best rate-of-climb speed on
              one engine for the Baron. You won't use this speed
              since you won't be losing engines during these
              lessons.</li>

              <li>The best rate-of-climb speed with both engines
              operating in the Baron is 105 knots. We'll use this
              speed for climb immediately after liftoff and hold it
              until reaching approximately 500 feet AGL (our safe
              maneuvering altitude). Then we'll increase our speed
              to 136 knots, which is a good cruise-climb speed.
              It's good for a number of reasons, in particular
              because this higher speed provides you with a good
              view over the cowling to look for traffic, and
              because it helps keep the engines cool.</li>

              <li>As a general rule, we will make all our
              approaches at 105 knots, unless we're trying to land
              on a particularly short field. Then we'll use a
              slower speed which we'll talk about in <a href=
              "CommercialLessons02.htm">Commercial Pilot Lesson
              2</a>.</li>

              <li>You can apply 15 degrees of flaps at speeds up to
              152 knots (the same as the maximum gear-extension and
              operating speed) Any more than 15 degrees of flaps
              requires you to be at 122 knots of below (the top end
              of the white arc) to prevent damaging those flaps.
              You'll notice that the Baron's flap switch has three
              settings as shown in Figure 1-28 <strong>TRANS</strong> or
              transition (meaning that the flaps are in the process
              of moving up or down), <strong>APR</strong> (approach flaps, 15
              degrees) and <strong>DN</strong> (down, full flaps).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you've gotten this far with this lesson, I think
            you've earned the right to begin your commercial
            training...so give it a try. Remember, it often takes
            several hundred hours of flight practice&#8212;to say
            nothing of ground study&#8212;for a pilot to earn a
            commercial license. So be patient: The Flight Simulator
            commercial lessons will be somewhat challenging. If it
            were easy, then everyone would be doing it.</p>
