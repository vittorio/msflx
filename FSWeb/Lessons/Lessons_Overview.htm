            Learning to Fly In Flight Simulator
          </div>

          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>Taking flying lessons in Flight Simulator is simple
            if you view the task as a series of steps. Follow the
            curriculum at your own pace, and most importantly, have
            fun. Your instructor, Rod Machado, has taught thousands
            of students to fly with his unique style of teaching,
            which includes a healthy dose of laughter with the
            lessons.</p>

            <p>There are five categories of pilot ratings, each
            rewarding the successful evaluation of piloting skills
            you've learned with a Flight Simulator Pilot
            Certificate.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Student Pilot&#8212;Learn the fundamentals of
              controlling the airplane</li>

              <li>Private Pilot&#8212;Expand your skills to include
              more difficult maneuvers and navigation</li>

              <li>Instrument Rating&#8212;Learn to fly solely by
              reference to the instruments</li>

              <li>Commercial Pilot&#8212;Step up to a bigger
              aircraft and learn more precise flying skills</li>

              <li>Airline Transport Pilot&#8212;Apply your flying
              skills toward learning to fly a Boeing jet</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">How the Lessons Work</p>

            <p>The Flight Simulator Flying Lessons are made up of
            ground school reading, interactive flying experiences,
            solo practice flights, and flight checkrides.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ground School Reading</p>

            <p>To start a lesson, click the link for the lesson you
            want to take. You can then read about the concepts
            behind the skills you'll learn in the cockpit. Reading
            this material helps you breeze through the lesson with
            more success. When you're ready to fly, click the Fly
            This Lesson link at the top or bottom of the page. Then
            you'll see a briefing describing specifically what will
            happen during the flight as well as the criteria for
            successfully completing the lesson. Click the Fly Now
            button, and you'll start the flying portion of the
            lesson.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Interactive Flying Lessons</p>

            <p>Once in the cockpit, Rod has control of the airplane
            initially and will talk to you about what he has
            planned for the lesson. You will do a lot of the flying
            while listening to Rod's instructions and explanations
            of each maneuver. If you are not flying as Rod
            requests, he'll prompt you to make corrections. You'll
            also notice text messages on the screen at this time,
            telling you the actions to take to correct the
            situation. Notice that messages turn from white to
            yellow and then to red as the corrective action is
            delayed longer and longer.</p>

            <p>If you're having trouble recognizing which
            instrument or control Rod refers to, hold your cursor
            over any item displayed on the panel. Within a moment,
            the name of the instrument pops up over the item. This
            is also a helpful way to learn the names of each
            instrument on the panel.</p>

            <p>At the end of each flight, you have the opportunity
            to view the Flight Analysis page, which gives you a
            graphical look at the path you flew during the lesson.
            This tool may help you better understand where further
            practice is needed or confirm that you flew the flight
            within the tolerances stated at the beginning of the
            flight. For more information about Flight Analysis, see
            the <strong>Flight Analysis</strong> article in the Learning
            Center.</p>

            <p>Note that not all menu items are active during the
            lessons. The lessons will not require you to make any
            changes to the aircraft, environment, or Flight
            Simulator. Likewise, not all lesson features are
            available in Virtual Cockpit. It is best to remain in
            Cockpit View throughout the lessons.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Solo Practice Flights</p>

            <p>Practice will help you learn and hone the most
            essential skills needed to pass the examinations at the
            end of each category. Practice sessions start in the
            same way interactive lesson begin. Some fights include
            more information before the flight about the skills you
            will practice&#8212;they are like mini-lessons. Other
            solo flights only describe the conditions of and
            objectives for the flight you are about to take.
            Regardless, each solo flight provides you an open-ended
            experience to learn more and practice. To end a solo
            flight, press <strong>Escape</strong>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Checkrides</p>

            <p>Start a checkride when you're ready to demonstrate
            your flying skills to the examiner. You will not be
            given instruction on these flights. The Examiner will
            evaluate your flying throughout the flight to standards
            described in the briefing before the flight. At
            predetermined places during the flight, your examiner
            will decide if you've successfully demonstrated the
            required skills within the tolerances described in the
            briefing. If you have not, you'll be asked to take the
            checkride again after some more practice. At that
            point, you can end the flight when you're ready by
            pressing <strong>Escape</strong>. When you successfully pass a
            segment, you'll be given instructions for the next
            portion of the flight. Once you pass each checkride,
            you'll be awarded a certificate that you can print,
            frame, and hang on your wall.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">What Else is There to Do?</p>

            <p>After you've completed the lessons and checkrides
            you want, try flying some of the Missions&#8212;they're
            a fun way to use your new skills. These fights give you
            the opportunity to try a variety of flying experiences
            that range from short, dramatic scenarios lasting a few
            minutes to lengthy, realistic flights of several
            hours.</p>
