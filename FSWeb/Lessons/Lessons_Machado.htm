          <p>To the delight of his parents, Rod Machado gave up
          riding with a vegetarian motorcycle gang known as The
          Sprouts, when he traded his motorcycle for flying lessons
          at age 16. Captivated by the romance and adventure of
          flight in a Taylorcraft L&#8211;2 at Amelia Reid Aviation
          in San Jose, California, Machado has remained hooked ever
          since. A friend once said that Machado's so excited about
          flying that it takes two glide slopes to bring him down.
          In fact, he claims to be one of the few Airline
          Transport-rated pilots who still gets a kick out of a
          Cessna 150 fly-by (which he claims he likes because it
          lasts so much longer than Mooney, Bonanza and Malibu
          fly-bys).</p>

          <p>Machado is a professional speaker who travels across
          the United States and Europe delighting his listeners
          with upbeat and lively presentations. Machado truly loves
          mixing it up with the audience. His unusual talent for
          simplifying difficult topics and adding humor to make
          lessons memorable has made him a popular lecturer both
          within and outside of the aviation community. Machado's
          presentations include topics as diverse as Risk
          Assessment, Defensive Flying, and Handling In-Flight
          Emergencies. His non-aviation topics include Safety
          Awareness, Humor as a Communication Tool, and The Lost
          Art of Thinking, He is also known for his humorous,
          rapid-fire banquet presentations.</p>

          <p>Machado boasts more than 30 years experience in
          aviation and has logged 8,000 hours of flight time the
          hard way: one CFI hour at a time. Since 1977, he has
          taught hundreds of flight instructor revalidation clinics
          and safety seminars, and in 1991 he was named the Western
          Region Flight Instructor of the Year. Machado holds all
          fixed-wing (powered) flight instructor ratings, as well
          as an airline transport pilot license. He's flown as a
          corporate pilot and has been a flight instructor since
          1973.</p>

          <p>For six years, Machado wrote and coanchored ABC's
          <em>Wide World of Flying</em>. He is AOPA's National CFI
          spokesman and a National Accident Prevention Counselor
          appointed by the FAA in Washington D.C. Machado is the
          flight instructor voice on Microsoft's <em>Flight
          Simulator</em>. He is the author of three books (<em>Rod
          Machado's Private Pilot Handbook</em>, <em>Rod Machado's
          Private Pilot Workbook</em>, and <em>Rod Machado's
          Instrument Pilot's Survival Manual</em>), four videos, and
          two audio cassette albums. You can read his monthly
          columns in <em>AOPA Pilot</em> magazine as well as in
          <em>AOPA Flight Training</em> magazine.</p>

          <p>Machado's eclectic interests reflected his equally
          varied academic credentials. He holds a degree in
          Aviation Science and degrees in Psychology. A firm
          believer that those who don't take time to exercise have
          to take time to be sick., Machado gets his exercise from
          practicing and teaching martial arts. He holds black
          belts in the Korean disciplines of Tae Kwon Do and
          Hapkido, and has studied Gracie Jujitsu for 10 years. He
          also runs 20 miles a week (and claims it's uphill both
          ways).</p>
