                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            <p>Look at the thick black line located in the plan
            view (position E) running from right to left down
            toward the airport. This is the instrument approach
            course that takes you to the airport (position F).
            Located on the airport is the VOR station (position G)
            that provides the navigation signal for the approach.
            Here's how you'd fly this approach.</p>

            <p>Let's assume your airplane is located at DARTS
            intersection (position H). This intersection shows the
            beginning of the VOR approach course. All instrument
            approach courses are identified by thick black lines in
            the plan view section. Notice that the VOR approach
            course consists of the 212-degree VOR course to the
            Santa Monica VOR. Your job is to get on that thick
            black line and fly the depicted course to the airport.
            And while you're tracking this course, you're also
            descending to the lowest altitudes, as shown in the
            approach chart's profile section (position C).</p>

            <p>So how do you get onto this approach course in the
            first place? ATC will either give you radar vectors
            (headings) to intercept the thick black line, or you
            can fly a VOR course that leads you to it (more on this
            later).</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Flying the Santa Monica VOR
            Approach</p>

            <p>To fly the 212-degree course to the VOR, tune your
            navigation receiver to 110.8 MHz (Santa Monica's VOR
            frequency, position I), and then set your OBS to 212
            degrees. Heading 212 degrees will align you with the
            approach course. From here, you begin tracking the
            212-degree course to the airport.</p>

            <p>The profile section shows that once you're past
            DARTS intersection, you can descend to an altitude of
            2,600 feet (position J). Many airplanes have Distance
            Measuring Equipment (DME). If yours does, you can
            obtain a DME reading from the Santa Monica VOR. As you
            approach the VOR, the DME counter shows your distance
            from the VOR decreasing. When the DME shows 6.7 miles,
            you're at BEVEY intersection (position K). Now you can
            descend to 1,120 feet. What's the reason for making
            descents in steps? You're kept above the higher
            obstacles located along the approach course. As you get
            closer to the airport, the obstacles usually aren't as
            tall. (Apparently, other pilots have already knocked
            the bigger ones down.) Therefore, you're progressively
            lowered on the approach course as you approach the
            runway.</p>

            <p>Finally, when the DME reads 2.4 miles, you're at
            CULVE intersection (position L). Since no lower
            altitudes are shown in the profile view, you need to go
            to the minima section&#8212;the section of the approach
            chart that identifies the lowest altitude to which you
            are allowed to descend on this instrument
            approach&#8212;(shown in position D) for the final and
            lowest altitude to which you can descend. The minima
            section shows 660 feet as the minimum descent altitude
            (MDA). To go any lower, you must have the airport in
            sight. You must have at least the one-mile visibility
            shown in the minima section next to the 660 feet to go
            any lower.</p>

            <p>If you don't have the airport in sight by the time
            you fly over the VOR, you're required to execute a
            missed approach. Therefore, if the VOR flag flips from
            <strong>TO</strong> to <strong>FROM</strong> and you don't have the airport
            in sight, you must fly the missed approach procedure
            (position M). This procedure takes you to a safe
            altitude from which you can plan your next
            approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">A Variation of the VOR Approach</p>

            <p>There are several variations to the VOR instrument
            approach procedure. Once you master these, you'll have
            no problem interpreting any approach chart. For
            instance, Figure 1-2 is the VOR approach to Long Beach,
            California.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson16Figure02.jpg" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-2</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>(You'll notice that there is a slight difference in
            chart format between Figure 1-1 and 2. Within the next
            couple of years, all approach charts will eventually
            change to the format shown in Figure 1-2). The approach
            consists of two main segments. The first segment is the
            300-degree course to the SLI VOR (tune the VOR to 115.7
            MHz, and set the OBS to 300 degrees). The minimum
            altitude along this route is 1,500 feet, as shown by
            position A.</p>

            <p>Once the <strong>TO/FROM</strong> flag flips and reads
            <strong>FROM</strong>, you need to turn and track outbound on the
            275-degree course that leads you to the airport
            (position B). Since the profile doesn't show any
            minimum altitudes for this section of the procedure,
            look at the minima section of the chart (position C).
            You're allowed to descend to 560 feet on this approach.
            Where's the missed approach point? It's based either on
            time (start your watch at the VOR and count down the
            time for a given ground speed) or a DME reading from
            the VOR. Both of the missed approach points are shown
            by position D.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Racetrack Course Reversal</p>

            <p>One last note on this approach chart: Notice the
            racetrack pattern shown in the profile view (position
            E). This is one of two means of course reversal (also
            known as a procedure turn). If you're heading to the
            VOR from the north, it's too sharp a turn to cross the
            VOR and fly the 275-degree course toward the airport.
            Therefore, you should cross the VOR and reverse course.
            Flying a heading of 120 degrees (position F) allows you
            to go opposite the inbound course. From here, you'll
            turn to intercept the 300-degree course to the VOR, and
            fly the 275-degree course toward the airport once
            you've crossed the station.</p>

            <p>Simply stated, your objective is to try and stay
            within the boundaries of the racetrack as you reverse
            course. Outside these boundaries, you're not given
            protection for terrain. Of course, in a simulator, this
            is no big deal. You may conk a few simulated mountain
            goats on the head, but so what? Since we're practicing
            to develop real flying skills, however, let's pretend
            this is real. What's the minimum altitude to fly the
            racetrack course reversal? This is shown in the profile
            view as 1,500 feet (position G).</p>

            <p>Therefore, if I'm heading down to SLI VOR from the
            north, I'll turn and fly a heading of 120 degrees after
            crossing the station. This should keep me close to the
            racetrack boundaries. After one minute (the time shown
            next to the racetrack in the profile view, position G),
            I'll turn left to intercept and track the 300-degree
            course back to the VOR and complete the instrument
            approach. Of course, this also assumes that I've
            previously set my OBS to 300 degrees. With slight
            simplification, that's pretty much how it's done in the
            real world.</p>

            <p>As an additional note, there are routes leading to
            the VOR (called feeder routes because they feed you
            onto the instrument approach procedure) that don't
            require a course reversal. Position H shows one feeder
            route starting at MIDDS intersection and listing the
            letters NoPT, which stands for no procedure turn. Along
            this route, you should fly the instrument approach
            without doing the course reversal. In other words, fly
            directly to the VOR and then to the airport.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Barb-Type Course Reversal</p>

            <p>The second type of course reversal is shown in
            Figure 1-3.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson16Figure03.jpg" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This is known as a barb-type course reversal (or
            procedure turn). Let's assume you're approaching from
            ITMOR intersection (position A). This route leading to
            the RDD VOR consists of flying the 224-degree course
            (tune the VOR to 108.4 MHz, and set the OBS to 224).
            The minimum altitude along this route is 3,700 feet
            (position B). Once you cross the VOR, turn and track
            outbound on the 175-degree course, as shown by position
            C (you must now set your OBS to 175). The objective
            here is to travel outbound, reverse your direction, and
            then track inbound and fly the instrument approach
            course.</p>

            <p>The profile view shows 2,000 feet as the minimum
            altitude for the procedure turn, which should be
            completed within 10 nautical miles (nm) of the VOR
            (position D). As you're descending, you'll travel
            outbound and, while still within 10 miles, you can turn
            to a heading of 220 degrees (position E). Fly this
            heading for a minute or less, and then turn left to a
            heading of 040 degrees (position F) and intercept the
            approach course inbound. This means you must reset your
            OBS to track to the VOR (turn the OBS to 355 degrees).
            Once inbound, you may descend to 1,260 feet (position
            G). When your DME (from RDD VOR) reads 2.6 miles, you
            can descend to 860 feet, which is the altitude shown in
            the minima section (position J). The &quot;M&quot; shown in the
            profile section (position H) depicts the VOR as the
            missed approach point.</p>

            <p>Notice the two feeder routes leading from ITMOR and
            RED BLUFF VOR to RDD VOR (positions A and I). Feeder
            routes are shown as slightly thinner than the
            instrument approach course, and they are always
            accompanied by minimum flyable altitudes. Neither of
            these routes lists the letters NoPT. Therefore, as you
            approach RDD VOR along any of these routes, you must
            fly the procedure turn as a means of reversing course
            before flying the instrument approach procedure.</p>

            <p>From the RED BLUFF VOR (position I), track to the
            RDD VOR on the 336-degree course (set OBS to 336), and
            then make a left turn after crossing the VOR and track
            outbound on the 175-degree course from the VOR. Then,
            you repeat the same course reversal process listed
            above.</p>

            <p>Did you get all that? I just took you though a quick
            course on VOR instrument approaches, something that
            usually takes instrument pilots months to understand.
            If you want to put an ice pack on your cranium, I'll
            understand. But believe it or not, there's only one
            more approach you need to look at in order to have a
            general idea about how most instrument approaches work.
            It's called the Instrument Landing System (ILS).</p>
