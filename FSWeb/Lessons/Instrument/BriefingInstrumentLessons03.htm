            <p>In this lesson you'll learn about flying a holding
            pattern at a VOR station.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>20 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>Complete the Student and Private Pilot lessons
            before beginning this lesson. Reading the Ground School
            material before starting this lesson will help you
            better understand the skills being taught. You should
            also complete the reading and practice in the
            Instrument Scan solo lesson. Completing the VOR or ILS
            approach lessons is not required. You may also want to
            complete the holding pattern solo lessons soon after
            taking this lesson to learn more about the three ways
            of entering a holding pattern.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>You'll encounter mostly cloudy conditions with some
            rain. You will need to fly the aircraft referring only
            to the instruments.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">RECOMMENDED CHARTS</p>

            <p>No charts are needed for this lesson. However, the
            Snohomish County Airport VOR approach chart may be
            helpful reference. Note that it helps provide
            frequencies and orientation information, but does not
            show the track of your holding pattern.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="../images/KPAE_VOR.jpg">Chart</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>You'll start this flight in the air at 4000 feet.
            You will enter a holding pattern, make a complete
            circuit, and then continue practicing the holding
            pattern as long as you want. (Press <strong>Escape</strong> when
            you want to end the lesson.) Your instructor will help
            you set the navigation radios and instruments.</p>

            <p>You will need to use either the aircraft clock or
            another timing device for the timed portion of the
            holding pattern.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>Shift + 3</strong> to bring up the GPS unit</p>

            <p class="SubHead">FLIGHT CRITERIA</p>

            <p>You'll be asked to maintain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Airspeed within 10 knots as assigned</li>

              <li>Altitude within 100 feet as assigned until
              established on the glide slope.</li>

              <li>Headings within 10 degrees as assigned</li>

              <li>Bank within 10 degrees of a standard rate turn,
              referenced by the Turn and Bank Indicator</li>
