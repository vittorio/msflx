            <p>You already learned how to fly a traffic pattern in
            a previous lesson. So what's the difference between
            flying a traffic pattern and flying a holding pattern?
            Well, you noticed that when you were flying a pattern,
            it was something you did visually. The hold patterns
            you will learn in this class are done exclusively
            during instrument flying.</p>

            <p>When an airline captain comes over the intercom and
            says, &quot;Umm... looks like we're gonna have to hold here
            for a while,&quot; you probably groan and think, &quot;Great. A
            delay.&quot; Well you know more about instrument flying than
            you think you do, because that's exactly what holding
            is designed to do: delay an aircraft. An airplane can't
            just pull over to a rest area when ATC needs to delay
            its arrival somewhere because of traffic congestion or
            weather conditions. So the controller tells the pilot
            to fly a holding pattern.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Hold That Pattern!</p>

            <p>A standard holding pattern looks like an oval
            racetrack anchored at a holding fix&#8212;a VOR,
            nondirectional radio beacon (NDB), or
            intersection&#8212;as shown in Figure 3-1.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson18Figure01.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The two straight legs are called the inbound and
            outbound legs. In a standard holding pattern, you make
            all turns to the right (nonstandard patterns,
            therefore, have left turns). All turns should be at
            standard rate. How long are the legs of the pattern?
            Long enough so that flying the inbound leg will take
            about one minute. Wind will affect the leg
            length&#8212;so if there's wind, you need to adjust the
            length of the outbound leg so the next inbound leg will
            also take a minute.</p>

            <p>Actually, flying a holding pattern is pretty easy,
            but figuring out how to enter one is something most
            pilots dread. To keep airplanes within protected
            airspace, the FAA recommends specific entry methods.
            Which entry method to use depends on your heading when
            you initially cross the holding fix.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Direct Entry</p>

            <p>Use a direct entry when approaching the holding fix
            in the same direction as the inbound leg (area C in
            Figure 3-2) .</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Fly to the fix and turn right (for a standard
            holding pattern) or left (for a nonstandard holding
            pattern), and proceed with the holding pattern.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Parallel Entry</p>

            <p>Use a parallel entry when approaching the holding
            fix in the opposite direction as the inbound leg and
            ending up outside the racetrack after crossing the fix
            (area A in Figure 3-3).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Turn parallel to the inbound course, fly outbound
            for one minute, and then turn toward the racetrack to
            intercept the inbound course. Return to the fix, and
            proceed with the holding pattern.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Teardrop Entry</p>

            <p>Use a teardrop entry when approaching the holding
            fix in the opposite direction as the inbound leg but
            ending up inside the racetrack after crossing the fix
            (area B in Figure 3-4).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson18Figure04.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-4</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>At the fix, turn toward the racetrack to a heading
            that's 30 degrees off the outbound-leg heading. Hold
            that heading for one minute, and then turn in the
            opposite direction to intercept the inbound course.
            Return to the fix, and proceed with the holding
            pattern.</p>

            <p>Sound complicated? Most pilots think so. Luckily, a
            simple, direct entry is the most common entry type,
            since a controller will usually tell you to hold as you
            approach an intersection along your route of flight.
            Practicing holds is a great way to exercise your
            instrument flying skills, and should the day come when
            a controller tells you to hold, you'll know what to do.
            Right now, click the <strong>Fly This Lesson Now</strong> link to
            practice what you just learned. Then, strut your stuff
            for the examiner in the Instrument Rating Checkride.
            Good Luck!</p>
