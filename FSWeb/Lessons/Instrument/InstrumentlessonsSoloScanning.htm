            <p>(From Chapter 2 in Rod Machado's Instrument Pilot's
            Survival Manual. For more information about Rod and his

            <p>There are three essential steps in the effective
            instrument scanning process. They are to be executed
            every time a major attitude change is made. All three
            steps should take approximately 10 to 15 seconds to
            complete. Here are the steps of the scan, in the order
            they should be done:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Step 1: Select attitude, power, trim, and
              confirm</li>

              <li>Step 2: Radial scan the primary instruments</li>

              <li>Step 3: Trim using the VSI and monitor the
              Big-6</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Essentially, the airplane is put in the desired
            attitude, power is adjusted and an initial twist of
            trim is applied to hold the airplane in this attitude.
            The correct operation of the most critical instruments
            is checked by a confirmation process. The primary
            instruments are then scanned in an organized fashion,
            and small corrections are made to fine tune the
            airplane to the proper attitude. The final trim
            adjustments are made, and the airplane's new attitude
            is monitored on the six main panel instruments,
            otherwise known as the BIG-6. This is the big picture
            of how the instruments are scanned in this three-step
            process. The specific details and reasons for each of
            the three steps follow.</p>
