              Step 2 of the Three-Step Instrument Scan
            </div>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Radial-Scanning the Primary Instruments
            </div>

            <p>Step 1, Step 2, Step 3: Doesn't this sound like a
            Fred Astaire introductory dance lesson? Well,
            instrument scan is best taught and understood by easily
            managed steps. In this sense, your dance partner is the
            instrument panel, and your eyes dance from instrument
            to instrument in an organized way. You've learned Step
            1 of the three-step scan-now on to Step 2.</p>

            <p>Step 1 allowed you to place the airplane in any
            attitude solely by reference to the attitude indicator
            (AI). Using the AI as your only means of attitude
            control, however, is like using a thermonuclear weapon
            to kill fleas in your apartment. It works, but lacks
            the precision your neighbors have come to expect in a
            bug bomb. As an instrument flyer, you need precise
            control of headings, altitudes, and airspeeds. Once
            you've selected a new attitude in Step 1, you'll
            proceed to Step 2, where you'll radial-scan the primary
            instruments and fine-tune the attitude selected in Step
            1.</p>

            <p>The purpose of Step 2 is to look at one or more
            flight instruments and then make any necessary changes
            in pitch, bank, or power to obtain the flight attitude
            desired. This, in turn, allows you to obtain the
            precise heading, airspeed, and altitude desired. The
            term radial-scan signifies that your scan starts at the
            AI, goes to a primary instrument on the panel, and then
            returns to the AI. The scan pattern is out and then
            back along the same path. Think of the path your eyes
            make as they start from the center of a bicycle's wheel
            and follow a spoke radiating outward and inward, as
            shown in Figure 1.</p>

            <p>Anything that's primary is important. And primary
            instruments give you the most important information for
            precise control of pitch, bank, and power. Each
            attitude you select uses three primary instruments: one
            for pitch, one for bank, and one for power. But how do
            you know which instruments these are? After all, you
            have several to choose from. To answer that question,
            let's go for a hamburger.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Instrument Names
            </div>

            <p>When you order food from the Hamburger Palace, the
            server pushes a button with a picture on it of the item
            you selected. Order a soda, and he pushes a button with
            a soda on it. This neat visual method frees up the
            server's mind to think about more important things,
            such as philosophy, ethics, and an alternate proof to
            Fermat's last theorem. Of course, if you say,
            &quot;Beautiful weather,&quot; the server might say, &quot;I'm sorry,
            I don't have that button.&quot; Let's use a similar labeling
            system to identify the primary instruments on your
            panel.</p>

            <p>I'd like you to place the labels shown in Figure 2
            directly onto your computer screen under each
            instrument shown (we won't label the VSI for now). Use
            a small quarter-inch strip off the sticky end of one of
            those yellow sticky notes. Don't use labels with
            permanent adhesives (there's always a job open for you
            at that burger joint if you do!).</p>

              Identifying Primary Instruments
            </div>

            <p>Figure 2 identifies the primary instruments for any
            given flight condition. Assume that you've just
            selected the attitude for straight-and-level flight.
            Which primary instruments should you radial-scan? Look
            at the panel and find those instruments labeled
            straight (heading indicator) and level (altimeter). The
            heading indicator helps you fly straight; the altimeter
            helps you fly level; and the tachometer shows the power
            setting selected. In other words, you can fine-tune the
            attitude for straight-and-level flight by scanning only
            these three instruments. Easy, huh?</p>

            <p>Suppose you've placed the airplane in the attitude
            for a straight climb (or descent). Which primary
            instruments should you radial-scan? Find the
            instruments labeled straight (heading indicator) and
            climb (airspeed indicator). The heading indicator helps
            you fly straight; the airspeed indicator helps you
            determine the proper pitch for a climb (or a descent);
            and the tachometer shows the power setting
            selected.</p>

            <p>Finally, let's suppose you placed the airplane in
            the attitude for a level turn. Which primary
            instruments should you radial-scan? Find the
            instruments labeled level (altimeter) and turn (turn
            coordinator). The altimeter helps you fly level; the
            turn coordinator helps determine the amount of bank
            required for the desired turn (you'll see how shortly);
            and the tachometer shows the power setting
            selected.</p>

            <p>Now you know how to determine which instruments to
            scan for any condition of flight. Next, you want to
            radial-scan the primary instruments and observe their
            indication or detect needle movement. Then, return to
            the AI and make an attitude adjustment (if necessary)
            to stabilize the primary instrument. Let's examine how
            we'd do this with straight-and-level flight first.
            We'll assume that we've just entered straight-and-level
            flight from another attitude.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              The Basics of Radial-Scanning
            </div>

            <p>All but the primary instruments for
            straight-and-level flight are blackened out in Figure
            3, the way they would be in real instrument training.
            We'll assume that you've just completed Step 1 and have
            placed the airplane in the attitude for
            straight-and-level flight. Begin Step 2 by
            radial-scanning the primary instruments and adjusting
            the attitude on the AI (if necessary) for precise
            straight-and-level flight. Before we continue with this
            discussion, let's talk a little more about
            radial-scanning.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson14Figure03.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The AI has the word &quot;start&quot; under it since this is
            where all radial scanning begins. Like the hub of that
            bicycle wheel, your scan will start here and radiate
            outward to a primary instrument. You'll spend about 1
            to 2 seconds on the primary instrument while checking
            for any deviations or needle movement. Then, you'll
            return to the AI and make corrections (if necessary) to
            stabilize the primary instrument.</p>

            <p>Of course, you can radial-scan more than one
            instrument. To do so, you'd start at the AI, go to a
            primary instrument, and then return to the AI. From
            there, you'd go out to another primary instrument and
            return to the AI, repeating the process over again with
            any instrument desired, always returning to the AI.</p>

            <p>For instance, in straight-and-level flight, you'll
            radial-scan the heading indicator (straight), the
            altimeter (level), and the tachometer (power). Starting
            at the AI, move down to the heading indicator. Look for
            any deviation from the desired heading. Return to the
            AI, and make a small change in bank (if necessary) that
            stops the heading change or returns the airplane to the
            appropriate heading. From there, move to the altimeter
            and look for any deviation from the desired altitude.
            Return to the AI, making a small pitch change (if
            necessary) that stops the needle or returns it to the
            appropriate position. The tachometer is radial-scanned
            last. Look at the tachometer and make a final
            adjustment in the setting (if necessary), then
            immediately return to the AI. Usually, there is no need
            to radial-scan the tachometer more than once during a
            major attitude change. Now, start over with the heading
            indicator, repeating the radial-scan until both
            instruments (heading indicator and altimeter) indicate
            straight-and-level flight. Here's how the sequence
            should look.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Straight-and-Level Flight
            </div>

            <ol>
              <li>Start at the AI, and radial-scan the heading
              indicator.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the bank (if
              necessary) to maintain 270 degrees.</li>

              <li>Radial-scan the altimeter.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the pitch (if
              necessary) to maintain 4,000 feet.</li>

              <li>Radial-scan the tachometer, and adjust the
              throttle position (if necessary) for a cruise RPM of
              2300 (there's usually no need to radial-scan the
              tachometer again).</li>

              <li>Keep radial-scanning the heading indicator and
              altimeter, making small attitude corrections, until
              the airplane is established in straight-and-level
              flight.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The secret to radial-scanning is to quickly scan
            each of the primary instruments at least once before
            spending additional time radial-scanning any one
            instrument in particular. This allows you to determine
            how close the airplane is to the desired attitude and
            gives you an idea about how much work will be involved
            in stabilizing the airplane. Let's examine how we'd
            radial-scan the primary instruments in a straight
            climb.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              A Straight Climb

            <p>Once again, all but the primary instruments for a
            straight climb are blackened out (Figure 4). Let's
            assume that you've just entered a climb straight ahead
            and are starting Step 2 of the three-step scan. You'll
            adjust the attitude on the AI for a precise climb at 80
            knots on a heading of 270 degrees.</p>

              adjust the RPM to a climb value of 2400 (there's no

              <li>Keep radial-scanning the heading indicator and
              airspeed indicator, making small attitude
              corrections, until the airplane is established in a

              degrees.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>There you have it. Knowing ahead of time what
            instruments to look at for precise control of your
            attitude takes the mystery out of flying
            instruments.</p>

            <p>Now let's try Step 2 of our scan on a level flight
            turn.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              A Level Flight Turn
            </div>

            <p>All but the primary instruments for a level turn are
            blackened out (Figure 5).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson14Figure05.gif" alt="" border=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Let's assume that you've just entered a level turn
            to the left at 4,000 feet and are starting Step 2. You
            should begin radial-scanning the primary instruments
            and adjust the attitude on the AI for a precise
            altitude of 4,000 feet and a standard rate turn.</p>

            <p>Huh? What's a standard rate turn?</p>

            <p>Standard rate turns allow the airplane to change
            headings at a rate of 3 degrees per second. In the
            previous classlessons, I suggested you make turns at 20
            degrees of bank. That's perfectly fine, but for greater
            precision, I want you to make them at a standard rate.
            You'll do this by adjusting the bank until the wing of
            the turn coordinator's airplane is on the second white
            index mark, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

            <p>Now the airplane will change headings at precisely 3
            degrees per second. A standard rate turn gives you a
            sense of how long it takes to complete a turn. After
            all, at 3 degrees per second, it takes two minutes to
            make a 360-degree turn and one minute to make a
            180-degree turn. Here's the sequence you'd use to
            radial-scan the primary instruments.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Start at the AI, and radial-scan the
              altimeter.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the pitch (if
              necessary) to maintain 4,000 feet.</li>

              <li>Radial-scan the turn coordinator.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the bank (if
              necessary) to maintain a standard rate turn.</li>

              <li>Radial-scan the tachometer (if necessary), and
              adjust the RPM to a cruise value of 2300 (there's no
              need to radial-scan the tachometer again).</li>

              <li>Keep radial-scanning the altimeter and turn
              coordinator, making small attitude corrections, until
              the airplane is established in level flight at 4,000
              feet in a standard rate left turn.</li>

            <p>If you've gotten this far, you'll soon be qualified
            to say, &quot;Who's the greatest pilot&#8230; and why am I?&quot;
            In our final example, we'll examine how to apply Step 2
            to accomplish a right-descending turn.</p>

              A Power-Off, Right-Descending Turn

            <p>All but the primary instruments for a descending
            turn are blackened out (Figure 6). Let's assume that
            you've just entered a power-off, right-descending turn
            and are starting Step 2 of the three-step scan. Begin
            radial-scanning the primary instruments. Adjust the
            attitude on the AI for a precise descent at 100 knots
            in a standard rate turn.</p>

            <p>Here's the sequence you'd use to radial-scan the
            primary instruments.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Start at the AI, and radial-scan the airspeed
              indicator.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the pitch (if
              necessary) to maintain 100 knots.</li>

              <li>Radial-scan the turn coordinator.</li>

              <li>Return to the AI, and adjust the bank (if
              necessary) to maintain a standard rate turn. (There
              is no reason to radial-scan the tachometer since
              you've reduced the throttle to flight idle.)</li>

              <li>Keep radial-scanning the airspeed indicator and
              the turn coordinator, making small attitude
              corrections, until the airplane is established in a
              standard rate descending turn to the right at 100
              knots.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In the next article, we'll complete the final step
            of the three-step scan. This is where we'll wrap up all
            the hard work of establishing the airplane in a new
            attitude. We'll trim, sit back, and enjoy the new
            attitude we've selected-at least until we decide to
            make another major attitude change.</p>
