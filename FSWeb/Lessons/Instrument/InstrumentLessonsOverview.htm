            <p>Earning a Flight Simulator Instrument Rating will
            make you a more versatile and proficient pilot. You'll
            enjoy new experiences with Flight Simulator's
            navigation and weather features. You'll do your
            instrument training in the same aircraft you used for
            your private pilot certification, the Cessna 172. While
            the basic maneuvers are the same, this time you'll
            learn to perform them solely by reference to the
            instruments. You'll master the art of the <em>instrument
            scan</em> and learn the intricacies of flying
            <em>instrument approaches</em>.</p>

            <p><a href="InstrumentLessonsOverviewRod.htm">Start
            your instrument training by reading what instrument
            flying is all about.</a></p>

            <p>There are few thrills in aviation like taking off
            into the clouds, flying for a few hours, and then
            breaking out with a runway at another airport in sight
            directly ahead. By the time you finish your instrument
            training, you'll be capable of getting from here to
            there in almost any weather. Here are the steps:</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Instrument Pilot</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 1: The VOR approach</p>

            <p>Learn how to use the VOR to get you down to the
            runway at Paine Field. This non-precision approach
            requires precise flying and timing to find the runway
            through the clouds.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 2: The ILS approach</p>

            <p>In this lesson on a precision approach, the
            Instrument Landing System (ILS) helps you fly to lower
            altitudes without visual contact with the ground, which
            translates into a better chance of landing in bad
            weather. The skills you learn in this lesson transfer
            directly to your instrument training in the Airline
            Transport Pilot lessons.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 3: Holding patterns</p>

            <p>Learn how to &quot;park the airplane in the sky&quot; in a
            holding pattern over the Paine VOR. It's not unusual
            for air traffic control to ask you to delay your flight
            by holding at a specific place and asking you to fly a
            &quot;race track&quot; around a radio navigation aid, in this
            case a VOR.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Instrument rating solo flights</p>

            <p>The first solo flight is perhaps the most important.
            First read about the techniques of instrument scanning,
            and then practice them in a flight. Without the
            instrument scan, controlling the airplane in the clouds
            will be virtually impossible. The navigation is not
            difficult, but controlling the airplane solely on
            instruments does take practice. The remaining solo
            flights help you perfect your instrument flying
            skills.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Instrument Rating Checkride</p>

            <p>Here's where you show the examiner how you control
            the airplane in the clouds. It'll be a cloudy day for
            your flight in the Cessna 172. Once you pass, you'll be
            awarded the Flight Simulator Instrument Rating
            certificate.</p>
