            <p>In this lesson you'll learn how to fly an ILS
            approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>30 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>Complete the Student and Private Pilot lessons
            before beginning this lesson. Reading the Ground School
            material before starting this lesson will help you
            better understand the skills being taught. You should
            also complete the reading and practice in the
            Instrument Scan solo lesson. Completing the VOR
            approach lesson is not required. Study the approach
            chart in this briefing to become familiar with the
            approach procedure.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>You'll encounter mostly cloudy conditions with some
            rain. Ceilings are forecasted to be around 300 feet, so
            you will need to fly the aircraft referring only to the
            instruments.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">RECOMMENDED CHARTS</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href=
              "../images/KBFI_ILS_13R.jpg">Chart</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>You'll start in the air and fly the ILS approach
            into Boeing Field. You'll intercept the ILS, track
            inbound on the localizer, intercept and fly the glide
            slope, and fly the approach while descending to the
            decision height (DH), and land on runway 13R.</p>

            <p>Your instructor will help you set the navigation
            radios and instruments.</p>

            <p>Be careful not to chase the needles when flying the
            approach. The dots on either side of the needles
            indicate how far you are off course or glide slope. The
            needles will become increasingly sensitive as you get
            closer to the runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>F7</strong> to lower flaps in 10-degree increments
            before landing</p>

            <p class="SubHead">FLIGHT CRITERIA</p>

            <p>You'll be asked to maintain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Airspeed within 10 knots as assigned</li>

              <li>Altitude within 100 feet as assigned until
              established on the glide slope.</li>

              <li>Headings within 10 degrees as assigned</li>

              <li>No full needle deflections while flying the
              approach</li>
            </ul>
