              Step 3 of the Three-Step Instrument Scan

              Trim using the VSI, and Monitor-Scan the Big-6
              Instruments
            </div>

            <p>By now, you know that instrument pilots are not
            folks who sit in airplanes and play piccolos or
            guitars. The closest they come to making music occurs
            as they follow a step-by-step instrument-scan procedure
            when making a major attitude change. So far, we've
            covered two of the three steps. Let's complete our
            instrument-scan procedure by studying the last step in
            the three-step scan.</p>

            <p>In Step 1, you made a major attitude change followed
            by Step 2, in which you fine-tuned the airplane's
            pitch, bank, and power. In Step 3, you'll offer a final
            twist of the trim so the airplane stays put, then
            you'll relax a bit and monitor-scan the six main flight
            instruments on your panel (also known as the Big-6
            instruments). Monitor-scanning is a more relaxed way of
            observing the flight instruments compared to the
            radial-scan of Step 2. Let's take a closer look at Step
            3 of the scan.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Step 3 of the Scan
            </div>

            <p>Your main objective in Step 3 is to make a final
            trim adjustment by referencing the vertical speed
            indicator (VSI). The VSI is sensitive to small pitch
            changes and will quickly indicate any deviation away
            from the desired attitude. Additionally, the length of
            the VSI's needle makes it easier to detect vertical
            movement.</p>

            <p>The secret of the final trim is to look for a
            constant VSI indication. When leveling off, trim so
            that the VSI needle indicates a zero rate of climb.
            Don't whip the trim wheel (or button) around like
            you're spinning a merry-go-round and trying to make
            your little brother sick. Give the trim wheel a slight
            twist, and then ease up on any control pressures you
            might be applying. Watch the VSI's needle. If it moves
            up or down, apply nose-down or nose-up trim,
            respectively, to stop the needle's movement.</p>

            <p>There's never any reason to completely let go of the
            controls to see which way an out-of-trim airplane
            moves. This causes pilots more heartaches than it's
            worth. By letting go of the controls
            instead of easing off a little on control pressures, an
            untrimmed airplane could rapidly deviate from the
            planned flight attitude, depending on just how out of
            trim it was. Now, you must return the airplane to its
            previous flight condition before you retrim. It's much
            easier to relax the control pressure, observe the
            beginning of any VSI needle movement, and make a
            corresponding change in the trim. Small adjustments in
            trim can now be made without having to recapture a
            runaway airplane.</p>

            <p>Trimming for a climb or descent is done in a similar
            manner to trimming for level flight. Relax control
            pressure, and watch for a constant VSI needle
            indication. Suppose the needle indicates a specific
            climb rate. If you relax control pressure and the
            needle moves, then the airplane needs trimming. Apply
            nose-up or nose-down trim as appropriate to stabilize
            the airplane at the previous climb rate (or descent
            rate). It may take two or three adjustments of trim to
            find a setting that works, but that's okay. You've got
            the time. It's not as if you're going anywhere, are
            you?</p>

            <p>Also, keep in mind that it's difficult to trim an
            airplane perfectly. Even if you're a high priest (or
            priestess) of trim, an airplane can still wander up or
            down a few hundred feet. There's not much you can do
            about this outside of making small, manual pitch
            corrections. Airplanes are not all created equal. A
            little dent here, a little extra weight there-all of
            these have a subtle effect on aerodynamic performance,
            which prevents an airplane from being perfectly
            trimmed.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Monitor Scanning
            </div>

            <p>After the final trim adjustments are made, the six
            main panel instruments (Figure 1) are monitor-scanned.
            This is often done in a clockwise fashion, going from
            the top row to the bottom row of instruments. Actually,
            you can select any particular pattern of eye movement
            that is comfortable to you. The objective is to monitor
            deviations from the established attitude. If you notice
            a deviation, make a small adjustment on the attitude
            indicator to maintain the desired flight
            conditions.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson15Figure01.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Monitor scanning is the condition in which you'll
            spend most of your time while on instruments. Step 3,
            therefore, is performed continuously until a new flight
            attitude is desired (thus requiring a major change in
            attitude). All three steps of the scan procedure are
            repeated again when making this major attitude
            change.</p>

            <p>The first two steps of the three-step scan typically
            take 5 to 15 seconds to complete. There will be
            instances in which you might have completed Step 2 of
            the scan and might not be able to move on to Step 3.
            For example, in turbulence or when you're on an
            instrument approach, you may find yourself obliged to
            rapidly radial-scan the primary instruments to maintain
            precise control of the airplane. Remember, radial
            scanning is a lot of work: physically, intellectually
            and emotionally. It is possible to radial-scan all the
            instruments on the panel, but this is usually
            unnecessary and can become tiresome. Radial-scan only
            those (primary) instruments necessary to control the
            airplane.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              A Tip from the Professionals
            </div>

            <p>Over the years, some professionals have reported a
            rather unusual method of detecting instrument deviation
            once the airplane's attitude has been established and
            the aircraft trimmed. These pilots focus their vision
            in the center of the panel just underneath the attitude
            indicator. Relying upon only their peripheral vision,
            they watch for any instrument movement. In much the
            same way a speed reader is taught to take in three or
            four words at a glance, instrument pilots can absorb
            information from clusters of instruments at a single
            glance. Developing peripheral vision takes practice,
            but it does seem to represent the higher art of
            instrument flying. Until then, when Step 3 of the scan
            is completed, keep your eyes moving around the panel
            while looking for attitude deviations.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Subtle Secrets
            </div>

            <p>The VSI, once mastered, provides additional useful
            information for the precise control of an aircraft.
            Most pilots also find the VSI useful for helping
            maintain level flight within the 10- to 20-foot range.
            Sometimes, it's easier to use the VSI to identify
            trends away from level flight because of the large
            swing arc and greater sensitivity of its needle. Taking
            time to learn to fly the VSI with precision pays off
            handsomely.</p>

            <p>There are many boring things to do in life, but
            instrument flying isn't one of them. The art of flying
            instruments is a challenging test of your mettle.
            Instrument flying offers you the opportunity to master
            the airplane and yourself. Perhaps this is why most
            instrument pilots are so happy. They realize the scope
            of their accomplishment. I should warn you, however,
            that looking really happy at the airport is often
            inconvenient. Someone might become suspicious and
            require you to take a drug test. Be cautious!</p>
