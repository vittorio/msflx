            <p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to fly a VOR
            approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>25 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>Complete the Student and Private Pilot lessons
            before beginning this lesson. Reading the Ground School
            material before starting this lesson will help you
            better understand the skills being taught. You should
            also complete the reading and practice in the
            Instrument Scan solo lesson. Study the approach chart
            in this briefing to become familiar with the approach
            procedure.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>You'll encounter mostly cloudy conditions with some
            rain. Low ceilings are forecasted, so you will need to
            rely on flying the aircraft referring only to the
            instruments.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">RECOMMENDED CHARTS</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="../images/KPAE_VOR.jpg">Chart</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>You'll start in the air and fly the VOR approach
            into Snohomish County Airport (Paine Field). You'll
            intercept a VOR course, track the course, fly a course
            reversal maneuver (procedure turn), fly the approach
            while descending to a minimum descent altitude (MDA),
            and land on runway 16R.</p>

            <p>Your instructor will help you set the navigation
            radios and instruments.</p>

            <p>Be careful not to chase the VOR needle when crossing
            the VOR. As you approach the VOR, the needle will
            become more sensitive and swing to one side or the
            other. As you cross the VOR, hold your heading until
            the VOR needle becomes more stable again.</p>

            <p>You will need to use either the aircraft clock or
            another timing device for the timed portion of the
            approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>F7</strong> to lower flaps in 10-degree increments
            before landing</p>

            <p class="SubHead">FLIGHT CRITERIA</p>

            <p>You'll be asked to maintain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Airspeed within 10 knots as assigned</li>

              <li>Altitude within 100 feet as assigned and not
              below minimum descent altitude (1060 feet) during the
              approach until the runway is in sight.</li>

              <li>Headings within 10 degrees as assigned</li>
            </ul>
