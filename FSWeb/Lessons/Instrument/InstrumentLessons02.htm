            <p>Are you ready to rock and roll? If you thought
            landings were fun, wait till you get hooked on flying
            the Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. I talked
            about it a little in the overview, but we'll go into
            more details here, since it's one of aviation's most
            challenging, yet satisfying, aerial activities.</p>

            <p>An ILS approach consists of a descent to a runway
            using both vertical and horizontal electronic guidance.
            It's accomplished by following two needles (Figure 2-1)
            located in the ILS display on your instrument
            panel.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Unlike other instrument approaches, this one takes
            you down to a height known as decision height (DH). DH
            is approximately 200 feet above the runway elevation,
            as shown in Figure 2-2.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson17Figure02.gif" alt="" border=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>From this not-too-lofty perch, you take a peek
            outside and decide if you can see the runway well
            enough to land (thus the name decision height). If
            unacceptable runway visibility prevents a safe landing,
            you apply power, climb, and head off to someplace else
            with better weather. Let's take a closer look at how
            the ILS approach is constructed.</p>

            <p>The ILS consists of two electronic beams. One beam
            is angled outward, and one is angled upward from the
            runway complex, as shown in Figure 2-3.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson17Figure03.jpg" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The outward (horizontal) beam is called the
            localizer. It helps align your airplane with the
            runway. You track the localizer by following the needle
            shown in Figure 2-3 (position A). If the needle is to
            the right, you go to the right; if it is to the left,
            you go to the left. A needle that remains centered
            means your airplane is tracking the runway centerline.
            Under no-wind conditions, you need only fly the runway
            heading to keep the localizer needle centered. If
            there's wind, you need to make small corrections to
            compensate for wind drift. Sounds easy, but it does
            take practice to perfect this skill.</p>

            <p>The glide slope is an electronic beam that's tilted
            upward at approximately a 3-degree angle (Figure 2-3).
            By centering the glide slope needle, shown in Figure
            2-3 (position B), you're flying an obstruction-free
            path down towards the runway. How do you keep the glide
            slope needle centered? Fly towards it just like a
            localizer needle. If the needle swings upward, then fly
            upward; if it swings downward, then fly downward. The
            objective is to maintain the specific rate of descent
            that allows the airplane to track the glide slope down
            to DH.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Constant Rate Descent</p>

            <p>For a typical ILS approach flown at 90 knots, a
            500-foot-per-minute (fpm) descent rate is required to
            remain on glide slope. Of course, if you fly the
            approach at a faster speed, you must increase your
            descent rate. Glide slope angle and wind are two
            factors that affect the precise descent rate required
            to center a glide slope needle.</p>

            <p>Let's suppose you want to fly a descent at a
            constant rate of 500 fpm at 90 knots (this is a typical
            profile that you'll use to fly an ILS approach). How
            should you go about doing this? First, you'll do this
            by reducing power from its present setting to 1,600 rpm
            and let the nose naturally pitch down slightly. Then,
            you'll adjust the pitch as necessary to maintain a
            descent rate of 500 fpm and adjust the power to
            maintain 90 knots of airspeed. Yes, this is a reversal
            of the control functions we used in a previous lesson.
            Using the controls in this manner allows you to
            maintain precise control of the descent rate required
            for an ILS approach.</p>

            <p>Here's how the sequence should look.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Adjust power to maintain 90 knots in level
              flight.<br>
              A speed of 90 knots requires a pitch attitude of
              approximately 6 degrees nose-up pitch in level
              flight.</li>

              <li>Reduce power to 1,600 rpm, let the nose pitch
              forward naturally, and adjust the pitch to maintain a
              500 fpm descent rate.<br>
              This requires approximately 3 degrees nose-up pitch
              on the attitude indicator (AI).</li>

              <li>Trim to maintain the attitude for this descent
              rate.</li>

              <li>Make small adjustments in power to maintain 90
              knots.<br>
              (Airplanes have inertia, so it may take a few seconds
              to change speed when moving the throttle. Be
              patient).</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Believe it or not, this is precisely what you'll do
            when intercepting the glide slope. Since glide slopes
            are normally intercepted from below, you'll fly level
            at 90 knots until the needle lowers to a center
            position in the ILS display (Figure 2-4).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Once centered, you'll reduce power to approximately
            1,600 rpm, adjust the pitch, and trim the airplane for
            a 500 fpm descent rate, maintaining 90 knots. Assuming
            you're in perfect harmony with the universe, the
            airplane will remain on glide slope all the way to DH.
            But you know how easy it is to get a kink in your
            chakra, so you can't count on your karma being perfect.
            Therefore, you'll need to make slight variations in
            descent rate to keep the glide slope needle centered.
            Let's examine this.</p>

            <p>Let's assume you're above the glide slope and must
            increase your descent rate to capture it. If you want
            to change the descent rate from 500 to 700 fpm, you'll
            need to place the airplane in a 3-degree nose-down
            pitch attitude, as shown in Figure 2-5.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-5</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You'll need to reduce power to keep the airspeed at
            90 knots. The secret to maintaining a specific rate is
            not to chase the VSI needle. Simply place the airplane
            at the precise attitude on the AI, and then make small
            pressure changes on the joystick to adjust the rate of
            descent.</p>

            <p>Let's assume you've captured the glide slope and
            want to change the descent rate back to 500 fpm. Do so
            by increasing the pitch to 3 degrees nose-up and
            increasing power to approximately 1600 rpm.</p>

            <p>Now assume you're below the glide slope and must
            decrease your descent rate to capture it. Change the
            descent rate from 500 to 300 fpm by placing the nose in
            a level pitch attitude, as shown in Figure 2-6.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Increase the power to approximately 1,700 rpm to
            maintain 90 knots.</p>

            <p>Remember, don't chase the VSI needle. Make pitch
            changes on the AI, followed by small pressure
            adjustments on the joystick to fine-tune the VSI's
            indication.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Radial-Scanning Primary
            Instruments</p>

            <p>ILS approaches are not the place to catch a little
            shut-eye. Following the ILS needles to decision height
            is a demanding task. That's why you never leave Step 2
            of the three-step instrument scan. In other words, you
            spend almost all of your time radial-scanning the
            primary instruments for a constant rate descent. Figure
            2-7 shows the primary instruments for an ILS
            approach.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The VSI is primary for pitch; the HI is primary for
            bank, and the AI is primary for power. These
            instruments are radial-scanned along with the ILS
            display (you don't, however, need to radial-scan the
            airspeed indicator that often). Therefore, these three
            instruments are continuously radial-scanned when flying
            an ILS, with other instruments occasionally included.
            Things are far too busy to perform the monitor scan
            found in the final step of the three-step scan.</p>

            <p>Additionally, not all glide slopes are created
            equal; some are angled differently than others.
            Therefore, they may require different descent rates
            based on the airplane with which they are flown. Figure
            2-8 shows the descent rates versus different
            groundspeeds required to fly various glide slopes based
            on this approach.</p>

            <p>At 90 knots, for this 3-degree glide slope, a 485
            fpm descent rate should keep you right on target.</p>

            <p>Now it's your turn. If you're having trouble
            tracking the localizer, look at the runway ahead of you
            and visually align yourself with it. Observe how easy
            it is to fly a constant heading when looking at an
            actual runway. Why is it easier? Because you get pitch,
            bank, and alignment information in one &quot;over-the-nose&quot;
            picture. When you can't look outside, it takes a
            trained instrument scan to acquire the same information
            from three different instruments: the AI, the HI, and
            the ILS display, respectively.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">A Few Important Secrets</p>

            <p>Now you have the basic idea about how ILS approaches
            are flown. So here's what the pros know: First, the
            most important instruments to radial-scan are the HI
            and the VSI. It's not necessary to radial-scan the
            airspeed indicator or the ILS display every time. In
            fact, you might limit your radial-scan of the airspeed
            indicator to, perhaps, once for every 10 radial-scans
            of HI and VSI. You can also reduce your radial-scan of
            the ILS display to once every three scans of the HI and
            VSI. Of course, you want to take in the altimeter,
            tachometer, and other assorted instruments on occasion,
            as time permits. Once you've found a heading and a
            descent rate that allows you to track the ILS, you must
            fly those values precisely until you have a reason to
            change them. And I do mean precisely: Good instrument
            pilots can hold a heading to a single degree and a
            descent rate to within plus or minus 25 fpm. Honest!
            But it does take a lot of practice.</p>

            <p>In turbulence, it's easy to have your heading and
            VSI indication bouncing all around. In these
            situations, it's best to fly averages. Do this by
            relying more on the AI for pitch and bank control. Find
            the pitch that allows for the approximate desired
            descent rate. Fly this pitch and keep the wings level
            on the AI.</p>

            <p>Additionally, it's sometimes necessary to make
            small, but jerky, motions on the joystick when flying a
            simulator. Unlike the actual airplane, you can't sense
            a change in pressure on the flight controls. This
            prevents you from anticipating a change in attitude.
            Furthermore, airplanes have rudders, which help
            fine-tune the airplane's directional control. You may
            not have rudders available with your simulator
            hardware. In that case, small, jerky motions on the
            joystick are sometimes necessary to keep the airplane
            at precise attitudes. If you do have rudder pedals or a
            rudder joystick, keep your motions nice and smooth!</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Wind Correction on the Localizer</p>

            <p>I recall the first time I told my dad that I needed
            some space as a teenager. He locked me out of the house
            and said, &quot;Now you've got all the space you need.&quot; At
            that precise moment, I understood the power of
            feedback. Feedback changed my behavior, as I know it
            will change yours, especially in reference to flying
            the localizer.</p>

            <p>When you first begin flying the ILS, head the
            airplane in the direction of the localizer. In the case
            of Oakland, the localizer direction is 294 degrees. Fly
            294 degrees, and watch the needle's movement. You want
            feedback in the form of localizer needle movement. In
            particular, you want to know which way and how much the
            needle moves as you hold 294 degrees.</p>

            <p>The movement of the localizer needle tells you two
            things: wind direction and wind speed (determined by
            how fast the needle moves). Once the needle moves from
            its center position (use a one-dot horizontal
            deflection), recenter it using a 5- to 10-degree
            intercept angle (IA). The smaller the intercept angle,
            the less likely it is that you'll overcorrect. Of
            course, if you use a 10-degree intercept angle and the
            needle doesn't move back to center or moves farther
            from center, then a larger intercept angle is
            necessary. You also know that you'll need at least a
            10-degree wind-correction angle once you're
            reestablished on the localizer.</p>

            <p>Once the localizer needle is centered, apply a small
            correction for wind. Try a 1-, 5-, or 10-degree
            wind-correction angle (WCA) based on your best estimate
            of the winds. With the WCA established, watch the
            localizer needle. If it returns to center, you know
            that the WCA is an angle between the WCA and the
            localizer direction.</p>

            <p>For instance, upon intercepting the localizer at
            Oakland, you fly 294 degrees. In a few seconds, the
            localizer needle begins moving to the left. You fly a
            heading 10 degrees to the left of 294 degrees, or an IA
            of 284 degrees, to reintercept the needle. When the
            needle recenters, you apply a 5-degree WCA to the left
            of 294 degrees (289 degrees). If this WCA works, the
            needle will stay centered. If not, repeat the process
            using smaller heading changes to recenter the needle.
            This technique is called bracketing, and it's the
            technique all professional pilots use (with slight
            modification) to center VOR and localizer needles.</p>

            <p>Practicing this technique is sure to save you
            embarrassment during later flights. The last thing you
            want is the localizer needle banging against the
            instrument case. That's when the passengers start
            asking those annoying little questions like, &quot;Hey,
            what's that clicking noise? You got your blinker on,
            Bud? Is that a time bomb, or what?&quot;</p>
