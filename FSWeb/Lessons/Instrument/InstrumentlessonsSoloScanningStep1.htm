              Attitude, Power, and Trim
            </div>

            <p>During most of the past classes, you've seen what
            flying is like when looking at the earth's horizon
            through the windscreen. Suppose I took that away from
            you. No, not the windscreen. I mean your outside visual
            references. That's what would happen if you flew into a
            cloud. In case you don't know this, you can't see very
            far when you're inside a cloud, which means it's
            unlikely that you'd be able to see the earth's horizon.
            Without visual references, you'd need to rely on the
            airplane's instruments to maneuver. That's what the
            next three classes are about.</p>

            <p>I plan to show you a three-step process for scanning
            your flight instruments. It's the same process I use
            when preparing students for their instrument rating (a
            license allowing them to fly inside clouds). If you
            take the time to master each step, you'll acquire
            skills similar to those possessed by airline pilots.
            The only difference is that you won't have 150 to 400
            people sitting behind you watching every move you make.
            First, let's make sure you understand what instrument
            scan actually means.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              The Scan Plan
            </div>

            <p>When pilots talk about scan, they don't mean CAT
            scan (which my cat doesn't like) or brain scan (which
            you'll need if you dent a lot of airplanes). They're
            talking about scanning the six flight instruments on
            the airplane's panel, as shown in Figure 1. Scanning is
            not just moving your head quickly enough to cause your
            eyes to rattle in their sockets like the last breath
            mint in the plastic box. It's a strategic process of
            knowing what instrument to look at, when to look at it,
            and what to do after you look at it. That's why I've
            broken the scan process down into three easy steps. All
            three steps are shown below, but I want you to master
            each step one at a time before combining them into a
            smooth, continuous process.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson13Figure01.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              The Three Steps
            </div>

            <p>Here are the steps in the order they should be
            performed:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>STEP 1: Select attitude, power, and trim.</li>

              <li>STEP 2: Radial-scan the primary instruments.</li>

              <li>STEP 3: Trim using the VSI, and monitor-scan the
              Big-6 instruments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These three steps are executed in sequence every
            time you make a major attitude change. For instance, if
            you're in straight-and-level flight and want to enter a
            climb, that's a major attitude change. Transitioning
            from a straight climb to a climbing turn is also a
            major attitude change. Essentially, any combination of
            the basic flight maneuvers involves a major attitude
            change. All three steps in sequence should take
            approximately 15 to 20 seconds to complete. In this
            class, you'll work on Step 1, followed by Step 2 and
            Step 3 in the next two classes. Master each step, and
            you'll master flight by reference to instruments.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              The Most Important Instrument
            </div>

            <p>Step 1 of the instrument scan involves one of the
            most important instruments on the airplane-the attitude
            indicator (called AI from now on). When you select the
            attitude in Step 1, you are looking at the AI and
            nothing else. You can afford to do this because the AI
            provides both pitch and bank information. Other
            instruments in the group give you a form of either
            pitch or bank information, but not both. This is why
            the AI is so valuable. Before we talk about Step 1,
            however, you need to understand something known as a
            wing leveling-and-pitch reflex.</p>

            <p>The wing leveling-and-pitch reflex refers to the
            skills necessary to help maintain any desired attitude.
            Maintaining a specific attitude isn't an easy thing to
            do. Pilots are often distracted from their scan, and
            turbulence frequently perturbs the airplane, both of
            which may induce a bank, resulting in an unwanted turn.
            Skilled pilots immediately correct this unwanted pitch
            and bank by reflex. Without thinking about it, they
            reflexively move the joystick and return the airplane
            to the desired attitude. Unless you've practiced doing
            this, you'll have to think about it before reacting.
            While a slow reflex may work if you're flying a blimp,
            it won't work in an airplane.</p>

            <p>You'll get a chance to develop your wing
            leveling-and-pitch reflex in the Interactive Lessons.
            Don't rush through this exercise. I can't express
            enough how important it is. I spend several hours with
            students in airplanes making sure they know which way
            to move the joystick to level the wings or maintain the
            desired pitch. If you feel you've mastered these
            reflexes (and still have some feeling left in your
            arms), then move on to Step 1 of the three-step
            scan.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Step 1 of the Scan
            </div>

            <p>Step 1 requires you to select the attitude, power,
            and trim conditions for the desired attitude. For
            instance, if you're in straight-and-level flight
            (Figure 2) and want to climb (this is a major attitude
            change), you'll need to select a climb attitude, apply
            climb power, and then trim for this condition. Do this
            by focusing entirely on the AI.</p>

            <p>From your previous experience, select the attitude
            that gives you the flight conditions desired. You still
            remember these attitudes from the previous lessons,
            don't you? If not, now may be a good time to review
            them. Figure 3 shows the approximate pitch required to
            climb at 80 knots with full power (13 degrees
            nose-up).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Here's how we'd complete the sequence according to
            Step 1 when entering a climb from straight-and-level
            flight:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Pitch the airplane up to about 13 degrees. You
              can't be sure that this will give you exactly 80
              knots, but that's okay for now. You just want to put
              the airplane in the approximate attitude. We'll worry
              about the details later.</li>

              <li>After pitching up, apply climb power (2550 RPM).
              (Don't apply climb power until the airplane begins
              pitching up. The pitch-up attitude puts an
              aerodynamic load on the propeller and prevents RPM
              overspeed as you apply power.)</li>

              <li>Apply trim to maintain climb attitude. (You're
              interested in a rough approximation of trim here. The
              final trim is applied in Step 3 of the three-step
              scan.)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Excellent! <em>Muy bien</em>. Now let's examine how
            we'd apply Step 1 of the scan as we make a major
            attitude change and return to straight-and-level flight
            from a climb.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Entering Straight-and-Level Flight from a Climb
            </div>

            <p>If you're in a climb, here's how you would return to
            straight-and-level flight using Step 1 of our
            instrument scan.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Pitch the airplane forward to the attitude for
              straight-and-level flight (Figure 2). You can't be
              sure you're in precise straight-and-level flight, but
              that's still okay for now.</li>

              <li>Wait approximately 10 seconds, then reduce power
              to a cruise setting of 2300 RPM. (Why wait 10
              seconds? Because you want the airplane to accelerate
              quickly to cruise speed before making a power
              reduction. In the next class Step 2, you'll wait
              until reaching a cruise airspeed of 100 or more knots
              before reducing power. Since you can't see the
              airspeed, use 10 seconds for now.)</li>

              <li>Once the power is reduced, apply trim to maintain
              the attitude for straight-and-level flight.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now let's examine how we'd handle entering a descent
            from straight-and-level flight using Step 1. The
            important thing to know here is the proper attitude
            when descending. Descents are typically done at
            airspeeds higher than that used for climbing. So let's
            use a one-half-degree pitch-down attitude, as shown in
            Figure 4. This will give you a descent at approximately
            100 knots. Remember the sequence: attitude, power, and
            trim. Here's how it should go.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Entering a Descent from Straight-and-Level Flight
            </div>

            <ol>
              <li>Select the proper attitude for the descent
              (Figure 4).</li>

              <li>Immediately reduce power to flight idle. (It's
              considered good form to make the attitude and power
              change at the same time. Reducing power results in
              the nose automatically pitching forward on its own,
              which makes it easier to establish the nose-down
              attitude. Lowering the nose with power on results in
              an increase in airspeed, perhaps beyond that which
              you want.)</li>

              <li>Trim to maintain the desired nose-down pitch
              attitude.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Next, let's examine how we'd enter
            straight-and-level flight from a descent. Remember the
            sequence: attitude, power, and trim.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Entering Straight-and-Level Flight from a Descent
            </div>

            <ol>
              <li>Select the attitude for straight-and-level flight
              (Figure 2).</li>

              <li>Add power to cruise RPM (2300). If you wait too
              long to add power, the airspeed will decrease. That's
              why it's usually good form to start increasing power
              as soon as the airplane approaches a level flight
              attitude.</li>

              <li>Trim to maintain the desired attitude.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This was an important ground school class. It's
            often the little things that give instrument pilots a
            difficult time, such as knowing how and when to change
            power. Granted, this may not be exciting, but it is
            worthwhile to understand. Now let's examine how we'd
            enter a turn from straight-and-level flight (another
            major attitude change) using Step 1 of our instrument
            scan.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Entering Climbing and Descending Turns
            </div>

            <p>In previous classes lessons, you learned that turns
            were made at 20 to 30 degrees of bank. This is
            appropriate for instrument flying, too. What you don't
            want to do is make turns in excess of 30 degrees of
            bank. Why? Turning too steeply increases a pilot's
            workload while flying under instrument conditions.
            Instrument flying is hard work, and the last thing a
            pilot needs is to struggle with the aerodynamic forces
            associated with steep turns. Let's agree to use 20
            degrees of bank for all turns while flying instruments.
            Later, you'll learn advanced turning concepts, such as
            standard rate turns.</p>

            <p>Since I know you're already skilled at turns, let's
            examine how we'd use Step 1 of our instrument scan to
            combine the turn and the climb entry during this major
            attitude change. This is just like a fancy dance step
            in which moves are combined, but no one's toes are
            jeopardized. The secret is to enter a 20-degree bank
            turn while simultaneously pitching to climb attitude.
            Here's how it's done.</p>

            <div class="LessonSubHead2">
              Entering a Climbing Turn
            </div>

            <ol>
              <li>Roll into a 20-degree bank turn to the right, and
              simultaneously pitch up to climb attitude (Figure
              5).</li>

              <li>After pitching up, apply climb power (2400
              RPM).</li>

              <li>Trim to maintain climb attitude.</li>

              <li>Now let's examine how we'd enter a
              left-descending turn using Step 1.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Remember, you've been practicing learning Step 1 of
            a three-step instrument scan. Once the attitude, power,
            and trim conditions are established, you're ready to
            move on to Step 2. Step 2 allows you to fine-tune the
            attitude selection you made in Step 1.</p>
