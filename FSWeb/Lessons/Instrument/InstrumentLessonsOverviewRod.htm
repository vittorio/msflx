            <p>Okay, time to grab a soda, and get prepared to sip
            and learn. That's right, get comfortable, because this
            lesson will consist mainly of a friendly little
            discussion about the principles of instrument flying.
            No, nothing super-secret is going to happen. No special
            handshakes. No passwords. Specifically, we'll talk
            about what an instrument approach is and why, when,
            where, and how it's done. When you're finished, you
            should be familiar enough to handle a basic instrument
            approach&#8212;the kind the pros fly in their jumbo jet
            airliners.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">VFR vs. IFR Flying</p>

            <p>In our earlier classes, we spent a great deal of
            time learning how to fly the airplane visually by
            looking at the horizon through the window. Pilots refer
            to this as flying VFR, which stands for flying under
            Visual Flight Rules. But what happens when you can't
            see the horizon, such as when clouds are present? Can
            you still fly? Yes, you can fly IFR, otherwise known as
            flying under Instrument Flight Rules.</p>

            <p>IFR flight allows you to fly in the clouds using
            your airplane's instruments to maintain control of the
            airplane and using your navigation equipment (such as
            VOR) to take you to another airport. This can all be
            done in the clouds without having to see outside, at
            least until you're ready to land the airplane, that is.
            Landing the airplane always requires that you see the
            runway well enough to land (Yes, even if you carry a
            lot of insurance and wear a helmet with a roll bar, you
            still need to see outside to land).</p>

            <p>To fly instruments, pilots need an instrument
            rating, which is obtained after acquiring the private
            pilot certificate. It requires additional training in
            such things as maneuvering the airplane by its gauges,
            advanced navigation, and so on. (And you must also
            promise not to tell other pilots how much fun it is, or
            everyone will want to do it). The bulk of instrument
            training deals with learning to scan the instruments,
            just like you practiced in the three scan lessons
            already covered.</p>

            <p>You're now ready to move beyond the instrument scan.
            You're ready for the next level, which, with some
            software programs, requires that you slay an enormous
            fire-breathing, multieyed beast. Well, not today.
            Reholster your laser-phaser and sip that soda, Yoda,
            because we're going to learn how to fly a full-blown
            instrument approach.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Instrument Flying: The Big
            Picture</p>

            <p>Instrument flying works this way. First, a pilot
            files an IFR flight plan with air traffic control
            (ATC). This is like making a dinner reservation at a
            fancy restaurant in that it alerts the restaurant staff
            to reserve space for you. Same with ATC. After the plan
            is filed and you're ready to go, you typically call the
            air traffic control tower at your departure point and
            tell them you have a flight plan on file. They say,
            &quot;Okay, we've accepted your flight plan and you're
            cleared for takeoff.&quot; It's pretty simple, and, unlike a
            restaurant, you aren't expected to leave a tip.</p>

            <p>With flight plan and clearance in hand, you depart,
            climb into the clouds (if clouds are present), and head
            on your way. Your objective is to follow the airways
            aloft to your destination. These airways are
            constructed from VOR courses that crisscross the
            country. How do you know which routes to follow? The
            same way you know which highway to take when you travel
            on vacation&#8212;the roadmap. Pilots, however, use an
            aerial version of this roadmap that shows all these VOR
            routes along with their minimum altitudes. These
            altitudes keep you from getting so low that you knock
            birds out of trees and people off buildings.</p>

            <p>All the while, ATC and its big fancy radar is
            keeping track of you and anyone else who happens to be
            flying IFR in your vicinity. If airplanes get too
            close, the radar controller separates the airplanes
            with verbal commands. No, not commands like, &quot;Hey, look
            out!&quot; or &quot;Dive! Dive! Dive!&quot; or &quot;Oh, the humanity!&quot; The
            controller simply vectors airplanes (gives headings to
            fly) away from each other until the collision danger
            has passed.</p>

            <p>As pilots approach the destination, they reach into
            their flight bag and bring out a special piece of paper
            that seems thin enough to be a Kleenex (but don't blow
            your nose with it, or the passengers will think Zamfir,
            master of the pan flute, is flying the airplane). The
            paper I'm referring to is called an instrument approach
            chart. It contains detailed instructions on how to
            leave the en route portion of the flight, approach the
            airport, and land, all the while using some means of
            electronic navigation (typically VOR). Most big
            airports have one or more of these instrument
            approaches (and charts). Figure 1 shows a typical VOR
            instrument approach chart.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Approach Chart</p>

            <p>Instrument approach charts have several things in
            common. First, at the top, they show the frequencies
            you'll use to talk to the local air traffic controllers
            (section A). Below this is a plan view, which shows the
            electronic navigational aids that you'll use to fly to
            the airport (section B). Below that is something known
            as the profile view, which gives you a few of the
            preliminary minimum altitudes you'll use as you descend
            to the airport (section C). Finally, at the bottom, is
            the minima section (section D). This shows you the
            minimum altitude to which you can descend as you fly
            toward the airport.</p>

            <p>There is a point known as the missed approach point,
            or MAP, and it's shown on all approach charts. At the
            MAP, the pilot must see the runway clearly enough to
            land. This point is normally shown by the symbol &quot;M&quot; in
            the profile section (section C). If you can't see the
            runway clearly enough from the MAP, you must make a
            missed approach. This means you'll most likely go to
            another airport that has better weather.</p>

            <p>Now that I've marinated your noodle with these
            ideas, I'm sure you're curious about how to fly an
            instrument approach. Let's find out. While there are
            several common types of instrument approaches, let's
            examine the most common one first. It's called the VOR
            approach.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The ILS Approach</p>

            <p>The ILS consists of two electronic beams: one
            provides horizontal guidance; the other, vertical
            guidance. What makes this approach more useful than a
            VOR approach is that it takes you directly to the
            runway and sets you up for a landing from a comfortably
            low altitude. The VOR (and other approaches) just take
            you over the airport, sometimes at hundreds of feet
            above the runway. This, of course, makes it more
            difficult to transition from the instrument approach to
            the actual landing. The localizer portion of the ILS is
            much more sensitive than the VOR course. By sensitive,
            I don't mean it will cry if you yell at it. I mean that
            the needle response to course deviation is quicker than
            that of a VOR. This makes it a little more challenging
            to keep the needle centered in the display (Note that
            the glideslope needle is also quite sensitive).</p>

            <p>Figure 2 shows the ILS Runway 28R approach chart for
            Portland International Airport (position A). The
            localizer frequency is 111.3 MHz (position B). Tuning
            this frequency in your number one navigation receiver
            (NAV 1, the top receiver in the stack of two), sets the
            VOR display to track one and only one specific course
            that's precisely aligned with the runway. This is
            called the localizer course, and, in the case of
            Portland, it's aligned in a direction of 279 degrees
            (position C).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson16Figure04.jpg" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Once the localizer frequency is tuned in, you can
            set the OBS to the inbound course for a heading
            reference (although the OBS is nonfunctional, since the
            VOR receiver is now tuned specifically for the
            localizer course only). Tuning in the localizer
            automatically activates a specific glideslope
            frequency, which is not shown on the approach
            chart.</p>

            <p>Let's assume that you're at 3,000 feet (the
            glideslope intercept altitude) at position D. You're
            flying a heading of 279 degrees, and the glideslope
            needle located within the VOR display is above the
            center position. This means you're below the
            glideslope. As you maintain 3,000 feet, the glideslope
            needle will eventually center (meaning you've
            intercepted it). Now you can begin your constant rate
            descent as we've previously discussed.</p>

            <p>Instead of making the step-like descents as you did
            with the VOR approach, the ILS allows you to follow an
            electronic beam down to the missed approach point while
            avoiding all obstructions in your path (assuming you
            don't go below the glideslope and start knocking birds
            out of trees and people off buildings).</p>

            <p>As you begin your descent on the glideslope, you'll
            fly over the outer marker, shown by the feathered
            vertical area in the profile (position E). This
            activates a blue marker beacon-light in the cockpit
            (and an alarm that sounds just like the beeper that
            goes off when the fries are done at your local burger
            joint). The outer marker notifies you that you're at a
            specific point along your descent (5.2 miles from the
            runway, as shown in the profile view at position
            F).</p>

            <p>How low can you go on the ILS? All the way down to
            decision height, or DH, which is 280 feet, as shown at
            position G in the minima section. DH is your missed
            approach point, and if you don't have the runway in
            sight by this point, you must execute a missed
            approach. Yes, I know there is an &quot;M&quot; shown at the
            beginning of the runway (position H). Sometimes pilots
            elect to fly this approach without using the
            glideslope. They do so because they don't have a
            glideslope receiver or the glideslope isn't working at
            the airport (someone may have yelled at it, hurt its
            feelings, and now it won't work). Therefore, the dashed
            line (position I) in the profile view shows the MDA for
            the localizer approach, just like the step-down
            altitudes you saw on the VOR approach. If I were
            cleared for a localizer approach, I'd cross the outer
            marker at 1,900 feet (position J), descend to 560 feet
            (position K), and fly to the MAP. The MAP is identified
            by time (based on a specific groundspeed from the outer
            marker) or by DME on the localizer, as shown by
            position L.</p>

            <p>Most everything else about this approach chart
            should now be familiar to you. For example, suppose
            you're over Battle Ground VOR (position M) and ATC
            clears you for the approach. The feeder route from BTG
            to the ILS is the 135-degree radial (position N). Set
            your VOR to track outbound on this radial until the
            localizer is intercepted. How will you know that you've
            intercepted the localizer? You can set one navigation
            radio (the bottom one) to navigate from BTG VOR and the
            other navigation radio (the top one) to receive the
            localizer. As you track from BTG VOR, you'll know
            you're over the localizer when the localizer needle
            centers. The outer marker beacon display will also
            activate in the cockpit as an additional clue, since
            the 135-degree course takes you to LAKER intersection
            (located on the localizer).</p>

            <p>At LAKER, fly 099 degrees (position O), descend to
            3,500 feet (position P), and make a procedure turn
            within 10 nm of LAKER. There is one important item you
            must know about localizers. Because the localizer is a
            single electronic beam, tracking opposite its inbound
            direction results in the needle appearing to read in
            reverse. In other words, when you are flying outbound
            from the localizer, if the localizer needle moves in
            one direction (right or left), you must fly in the
            opposite direction (left or right, respectively) to
            center it. This is known as reverse sensing. Therefore,
            as you prepare to fly the procedure turn by tracking
            outbound on the localizer, you'll have to fly opposite
            the direction the needle swings to keep it
            centered.</p>

            <p>Once you've completed the procedure turn and are
            inbound headed 279 degrees, the needle will indicate
            normally. You may descend to 3,000 feet (the glideslope
            intercept altitude) once established inbound on the
            localizer and after making the procedure turn. Track
            the localizer, and fly the glideslope down to DA. We'll
            talk more about how to fly an ILS shortly.</p>

            <p>That's a lot for an overview, but at least you've
            been exposed to the fundamentals of flying instrument
            approaches. Perhaps you feel like you've been exposed
            to a concussion, too. Granted, it does take a little
            practice to get good at this. However, flying
            instrument approaches is a lot of fun. It's even
            addictive. So don't be surprised someday to find
            yourself undergoing instrument flying withdrawals if
            your computer breaks down.</p>
