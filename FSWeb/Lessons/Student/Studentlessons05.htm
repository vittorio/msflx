            <p>Years ago, a fellow flight instructor had a student
            who spent a few too many hours on the high seas. On his
            first flight lesson, he walked out to the airplane,
            loosened all three tie-down ropes, tossed them aside,
            and yelled, &quot;Castoff!&quot; Hmmm, apparently, he still had a
            little sea water on the brain.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but airplanes don't do castoffs; they do
            takeoffs. And once you're in the air, you need a
            practical way to return to an airport in preparation
            for landing. It's similar to bringing a boat in to
            dock. You don't just barge into the herd of boats
            heading for port. You get in line and follow the other
            boaters and fishermen back home. This way, they don't
            get upset, which can lead to fishticuffs. And that will
            put the fear of cod in you.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Up, Up, and Away</p>

            <p>On takeoff, your objective is to accelerate the
            airplane to a sufficient speed where you can raise the
            nose to a climb attitude. This is sometimes known as
            rotating. I recommend rotating at least 5 knots above
            the airplane's no-flap stalling speed (which, in the
            case of our lessons' plane, is 50 knots-the beginning
            of the airspeed indicator's green arc). When the
            airspeed indicator shows 75 knots, raise the nose to
            the attitude that results in an 80-knot climb. (You'll
            learn what this attitude is from experience. In this
            case, it's approximately 11 degrees nose-up pitch,
            which is just above the second calibration mark on the
            attitude indicator.) Ready? Here's how to do it.</p>

            <p>First, apply full power and accelerate down the
            runway centerline. When the airspeed indicator shows 55
            knots, the airplane's ready to fly. So fly. Rotate the
            nose to an 11-degree positive pitch, as shown in Figure
            5-1.</p>

                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>It takes a little extra initial back pressure on the
            joystick to unstick the airplane from the runway during
            rotation. Be patient. The airplane will eventually
            accelerate to 75 knots at this attitude.</p>

                  Takeoff</p>

                  <p>If you're using rudder pedals and don't have
                  the Autorudder feature active, then you should
                  expect the airplane to yaw to the left when you
                  add power. This happens for several reasons.
                  Things like the propeller slipstream and engine
                  torque all contrive to make this airplane turn
                  left during takeoff. Just add enough right rudder
                  to keep the airplane aligned with the runway. Of
                  course, if you don't have rudder pedals, don't
                  worry about the airplane tending to turn left on
                  takeoff. Flight Simulator's Autorudder feature
                  will prevent these forces from affecting you.</p>

            <p>Of course, what goes up must eventually come down.
            And when it does, it better be able to land properly.
            That's why our next class will cover landings.</p>
