            <p>One of the greatest pleasures a flight instructor
            can have is to solo a student. Since you are my
            student, I have the great pleasure of soloing you in
            this lesson.</p>

            <p>This is the time in your training where you get to
            test your mettle in the metal as you take the Cessna
            172 around the airport for a single traffic pattern
            circuit by yourself. Alone. Individually.
            Unaccompanied. Solo.</p>

            <p>Let's be clear about how solo works. You'll fly on
            your own, without any direct help from me, your
            instructor. It doesn't mean that you fly closer to the
            ground, as in flying &quot;so low,&quot; nor does it mean you'll
            sing without musical accompaniment in the airplane,
            although you're certainly welcome to do so if you feel
            inspired. How you elect to amuse yourself when I'm not
            with you is your business. I'd like to offer for your
            consideration that great opera classic, &quot;O Solo
            Mio.&quot;</p>

            <p>In this lesson your flying performance will be
            entirely up to you. I will, however, be talking with
            you via the radio, so I can, in a manner of speaking,
            air-wave to you.</p>

            <p>To make this lesson meaningful, I'll provide the
            directions on when and where to maneuver the airplane.
            All you have to do is apply the aviation knowledge
            you've already acquired. Since I'll be speaking with
            you via radio, I'll tell you when you're cleared for
            takeoff and give you headings and altitudes to fly that
            should bring you back for a landing. . . at the same
            airport from which you departed. I will take you to the
            left around the airport, in a rectangular traffic
            pattern, eventually aligning you with Runway 19 for
            landing.</p>

            <p>You'll start this lesson by holding in position on
            Runway 19 at Bremerton airport. You might hear the
            distant sound of a jackhammer before departure. Don't
            worry, no one is repairing the runway. It's only the
            sound of your heart beating, and this is quite normal.
            This is an exciting event and you should be excited.
            When we're ready, I'll have you release the brakes,
            apply power and accelerate. At 55 knots you'll rotate
            the nose to an initial climb attitude of 10 degrees
            (Figure 7-1).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 7-1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Thereafter, you'll make slight adjustments in pitch
            to give you a climb speed of 80 knots.</p>

            <p>At this point, if you wanted to bellow out a few
            words to &quot;Please Release Me,&quot; this would be appropriate
            and no one would fault you. So have at it.</p>

            <p>You'll climb out at 80 knots on a heading of 190
            degrees (Figure 7-2) to 1,500 feet, where you'll level
            off.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure02.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 7-2</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You'll want to adjust your power to keep your
            airspeed below 100 knots and make sure the airplane is
            properly trimmed. Remember, an untrimmed airplane means
            you must use excessive muscular force to fly the
            airplane. If you want to build big biceps, do it in the
            gym, not the airplane. Never fight with your
            airplane.</p>

            <p>During this solo, I'll expect you to maintain your
            altitude within +/- 100 feet; your airspeed within +/-
            10 knots; your heading by +/- 10 degrees and any
            requested pitch attitude within +/- 3 degrees. I'd also
            like you to make all turns at no more than a 20 degree
            bank. So try and keep your bank angle within +/- 10
            degrees of 20 degrees. At this point in your training,
            I know I can bank on your skill at doing this&#8230;
            unless I'm nuts, in which cash I'll cashew in.</p>

            <p>Once you're level at 1,500 feet and the airplane is
            stabilized in level flight, I'll have you make a
            90-degree turn to the left, to a heading of 100 degrees
            (Figure 7-3).</p>

            <p>This is called the crosswind leg of the traffic
            pattern, which we'll talk about later in the Private
            Pilot lessons. Keep in mind that the runway is
            somewhere behind your left shoulder at this point.
            Unless you have an old-but-serious football injury that
            resulted in both shoulders now being on the right side
            of your body, you should be able to look to the left
            and see the runway (Figure 7-4).</p>

            <p>When I give you the cue, I want you to make another
            90 degree turn to the left to a heading of 010 degrees.
            This will have you flying in the opposite direction of
            takeoff, with the runway somewhere off your left
            (Figure 7-5).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>Since we took off into the wind, you'll be flying
            downwind at this time. That's why this leg of our
            circuit is called the downwind leg. Don't you wish
            calculus was this easy? Press 4 again on the numeric
            keypad, and see if you can find the runway.</p>

            <p>When the airplane is abeam the runway's landing
            threshold (meaning the runway numbers at the beginning
            of the runway on which you'll land are directly off
            your left wing as shown in Figure 7-6), I'll want you
            to add 10 degrees of flaps in preparation for
            landing.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure06.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 7-6</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Don't worry about adjusting the power here. Just
            apply the flaps and adjust the pitch to keep the
            airplane level at 1,500 feet. Then use a little trim to
            take the pressure off your joystick. Let the airspeed
            decrease a bit. I'm not worried about having you
            maintain a specific airspeed at this point.</p>

            <p>One of the most important things about applying
            flaps at this position is that it allows you to have a
            better view over the airplane's nose. This is a good
            thing, because if you're going to land it's very
            helpful to be able to see the runway. In a real
            airplane, applying 10 degrees of flaps helps pilots who
            are &quot;vertically challenged&quot; to see over the airplane's
            nose. I've had many young students (and a few older
            ones) who weren't yet done with their growth spurt, and
            they really appreciated what flaps did for them. It
            sure beats having to ask the flight school for a
            booster seat.</p>

            <p>As long as the airplane is below 110 knots you can
            apply 10 degrees of flaps without worrying about them
            coming off the airplane. Applying flaps at too high a
            speed can damage them. This would cause a flap, might
            hurt you and the airplane, and can result in just
            enough tragedy to inspire someone to write a
            country-and-western song about you.</p>

            <p>Now you're nearing the position where you'll make
            another 90 degree turn to the left. When it's time,
            I'll instruct you to turn left to a heading of 280
            degrees as shown in Figure 7.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure07.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Make the turn at 20 degrees of bank and keep the
            airplane in level flight until I tell you to begin a
            descent for landing. This position establishes a base
            from which we'll prepare to land the airplane. This is
            why this leg of our pattern circuit is called base leg.
            I seem to have an answer for everything, don't I? This
            almost got me in trouble when I was a kid. I was
            talking back to my grandpa when he said, &quot;Hey, you've
            got an answer for everything, don't you?&quot; Of course, I
            immediately replied, &quot;No I don't.&quot; That night I caught
            him trying to erase my name from my birth certificate.
            Ouch!</p>

            <p>When you're in position for the final turn, which
            aligns you with the runway, I'll give you the cue to
            make a final 90 degree turn, to a heading of 190
            degrees (Figure 7-8).</p>

            </table>

            <p>This will align you with the runway and put you on
            what is known as the final approach course. You should
            see the runway directly ahead of you (Figure 7-9). At
            this point you'll have to decide when to begin slowing
            the airplane down and starting your descent for
            landing. Do whatever you need to do with the power and
            flaps to land this airplane just as you've done in
            previous lessons. I'm leaving all this up to you since
            this is your first solo flight. Make sure to use the
            PAPI to help you remain on the glide path.</p>

            <p>If this were a solo in a real airplane, you'd see a
            little bitty fellow standing by the side of the runway
            cheering you on. So just imagine that you see me down
            there waiting for you to arrive and land safely. I
            won't be saying much from here on out. You're on your

            <p>When you land, you'll hear me congratulate you on a
            job well done. I will, of course, expect you to do a

                  <p>No one knows the origin, exactly, of when it
                  became the custom to cut the shirttail off of a
                  fledgling student pilot's shirt, but it's a
                  tradition that's still practiced by thousands of
                  instructors on the occasion of the student's
                  first solo flight. Some say it's from the old
                  days of open tandem cockpits, where the
                  instructor sat in the rear seat and the student
                  sat in the front seat. To get the student's
                  attention, the instructor would lean forward and
                  tug on the student's shirttail. Solo flight
                  equals no instructor, hence, no need for
                  shirttail tugging.</p>

                  <p>It's a fun custom, and there's nothing that
                  brings more pride to me as an instructor than
                  when I'm watching a student pilot take to the
                  skies alone for the first time.</p>

                  <p>Now, it's your turn to solo. Get out there,
                  make me proud. If you're successful, then print
                  out your solo certificate at the end of your
                  flight. You'll see that it's an image of a torn
                  shirttail commemorating this exciting event.</p>
