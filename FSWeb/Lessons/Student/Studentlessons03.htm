            <p>In the fifth grade, my teacher asked me to come to
            the front of the class and name the parts of speech. I
            walked up, turned around, and calmly replied, &quot;Lips,
            tongue, lungs, and oxygen.&quot; Well, apparently that
            wasn't the answer she was looking for.</p>

            <p>Speech has its basic components, and so does
            aviation. So far, we've practiced two of the four most
            important fundamentals of flight: straight-and-level
            flight, and turns. Now it's time to practice the final
            two: climbs and descents.</p>

            <p>One of aviation's biggest misconceptions is that
            airplanes climb because of excess lift. This is similar
            to believing that putting hand lotion in your
            airplane's fuel tank will make your landings smoother,
            softer, and younger looking.</p>

            <p>Airplanes climb because of excess thrust, not excess
            lift. Let's return to the example of a car on the road
            to learn a little bit more about why this is.</p>

            <p>A car traveling uphill is similar to an airplane in
            a climb. The only difference is that you (the pilot)
            choose the slope of the hill you climb. This is done
            using the elevator control that we discussed
            earlier.</p>

            <p>On a level stretch of road, the maximum forward
            speed of the car with full power is 65 mph (Figure 3-1,
            Car A).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson3Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-1 Power and Climb
                Angle.<br>
                Even with full power, the car starts to slow down
                as the hill steepens.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>As we move up a hill (Car B), the speed drops to 50
            mph. An even steeper hill slows the car to 40 mph (Car
            C). The limited horsepower of the car's engine simply
            can't match the drag caused by wind resistance plus the
            rearward-acting weight as the hill steepens, so the car
            slows. A bigger engine or a redesign of the car to
            produce less wind resistance are the only options that
            could help this tired old machine climb the hill
            faster.</p>

            <p>The same analysis works, up to a point, for an
            airplane attempting to climb a &quot;hill&quot; in the air.</p>

            <p>Let's say our airplane has a maximum speed of 120
            mph in straight-and-level flight with full throttle
            (Airplane A in Figure 3-2).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

                down<br>
                as it attempts to ascend a steeper hill.<br>
                Pilots adjust their climb angle (hill size) by
                selecting<br>
                an altitude that gives them a specific climb
                airspeed.<br></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Think of airplane throttles as being similar to
            automobile accelerator pedals, except that an airplane
            throttle is hand-operated; you push in for more power
            and pull out for less. Applying slight back pressure on
            the elevator control points the airplane's nose upward
            (Airplane B). This causes the airplane to climb a
            shallow hill, and the speed decreases to, let's say, 80
            mph, just as it did in the car. Attempting to climb a
            steeper hill (Airplane C) slows our speed down to 70
            mph. We can't climb the hill we just selected faster
            than 70 mph because we don't have the extra horsepower
            (thrust) to do so.</p>

            <p>As we continue to steepen the angle of climb, our
            airspeed decreases further, just like the car's speed
            did. Here, however, is where the airplane goes its own
            way from the car analogy. Airplanes need to maintain a
            minimum forward speed for their wings to produce the
            lift required to stay airborne. Ever wonder why
            airplanes need runways? Same reason long-jumpers do.
            Airplanes (and long-jumpers) must attain a certain
            speed before they can take flight.</p>

            <p>This minimum forward speed is called the stall speed
            of the airplane. It's an important speed that changes
            with variations in weight, flap setting, power setting,
            and angle of bank. It also varies among airplanes.
            (There's no need to worry because later I'll show you
            how to recognize when you're near a stall.) As long as
            the airplane stays above its stall speed, enough lift
            is produced to counter the airplane's weight, and the
            airplane will fly.</p>

            <p>If the stall speed of Airplane C (Figure 3-2) is 60
            mph, then climbing at a slightly steeper angle will
            result in insufficient lift for flight. We call this
            condition a stall. Done unintentionally, it leads to
            such primitive linguistic sounds as, &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; &quot;Yipes,&quot;
            and &quot;Ahhhhh,&quot; as well as, &quot;I think I need to have my
            chakras balanced.&quot; (Flight instructors have special
            biological filters installed that keep them from making
            these sounds on those rare occasions when you
            unintentionally stall the airplane.) Needless to say,
            in a real airplane, these sounds make passengers
            reluctant to ever fly with you again. This is why an
            upcoming lesson will be spent finding out about stalls
            and doing them (intentionally, that is).</p>

            <p>What you need to know about stalls is that airplanes
            with a lot of power (like jet fighters) can climb at
            steep angles; those with limited power, however, must
            climb at less steep angles.</p>

            <p>Knowing it's extra thrust and not extra lift from
            the wings that is responsible for the climb allows you
            to draw some interesting conclusions. For instance,
            anything that causes the engine to produce less power
            prevents you from achieving your maximum rate of climb.
            Among the things resulting in less power production are
            high altitudes and high temperatures. Not applying full
            power for a climb is also another condition that gives
            you less power, but that's a no-brainer, right?</p>

            <p>At this point, you should be asking an important
            question. I certainly don't mean questions of the Zen
            koan type, such as, &quot;What is the sound of one cylinder
            firing?&quot; or &quot;If an airplane lands hard in the forest
            and nobody is there to hear it, does it really make a
            sound?&quot; A good question for you to ask is, &quot;How can I
            determine the proper size &quot;hill&quot; for my airplane to
            climb?&quot; Let's find out.</p>

            <p>Airplanes have a specific climb attitude (steepness
            of hill) that offers the best of all
            worlds&#8212;optimum climb performance while keeping
            the airplane safely above its stall speed. You can
            determine the proper climb attitude for your airplane
            by referring to its airspeed indicator.</p>

            <p>With climb power applied (usually full throttle in
            smaller airplanes), the pitch attitude is adjusted
            until the airspeed indicates the proper climb speed. In
            the Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172 that we use in our
            lessons, we'll use a speed of 75 knots for all our
            climbs. Sometimes, however, pilots climb at airspeeds
            slightly faster than 75 knots. No, they don't do this
            because they want to get somewhere faster. They do it
            because it provides them with better over-the-nose
            visibility.</p>

            <p>Raising the nose of the airplane results in a slower
            airspeed; lowering it picks up the pace. Where you
            place the nose&#8212;that is, the attitude you select
            or how steep you make the &quot;hill&quot;&#8212;determines what
            happens on the airspeed indicator. Unlike the
            ground-bound world, pilots decide how steep the hills
            in the air are going to be (within limits of course!).
            With just a little experience, you'll be able to
            determine the correct size hill (nose-up attitude) by
            looking out the front window instead of having to rely
            solely on the airspeed indicator. When I was a student
            pilot, it seemed that any specific airspeed was the one
            place on the dial where the pointer never went. I was
            not gifted with much coordination as a youngster. My
            reflexes were so slow, I was almost run over by two
            guys pushing a car with a flat tire. I'm a living
            exhibit that one can be a competent pilot even without
            the coordination and reflexes of a 13-year-old Olympic
            gymnast.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Descents</p>

            <p>While engine power moves a car uphill, gravity pulls
            it down. Without your foot on the accelerator, the
            car's downward speed is determined by the steepness of
            the hill it's descending. The steeper the hill, the
            faster it goes. If the hill becomes shallower, then the
            speed decreases. If the hill becomes too shallow, then
            some power is necessary to maintain sufficient forward
            speed.</p>

            <p>Airplanes can also move downhill without power
            (Figure 3-3).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>Just lower the nose, and you'll get what appears to
            be a free ride (it isn't, but let's not get into that).
            You can adjust the nose-down pitch attitude using the
            elevator control and descend at any (reasonable)
            airspeed you want.</p>

            <p>You now have the answer to a question I guarantee
            every first-time passenger will either ask or want to
            ask you: &quot;What happens if the engine quits?&quot; The
            airplane becomes a glider, not a rock.</p>

            <p>Unlike climbing, you may elect to descend within a
            wide range of airspeeds. There are, however, many
            factors to be considered, such as forward visibility,
            engine cooling, and the structural effects of
            turbulence on the airframe. (All of these items are
            discussed thoroughly in my Private Pilot Handbook,
            which is available from my Web site. You can get
            directly to it using my link on the Flight Simulator
            Partners page.)</p>

            <p>However, during the last portion of the landing
            approach (known as final approach), you should maintain
            a specific airspeed. Usually, this speed is at least 30
            percent above the airplane's stall speed. When
            preparing to touch down, excess airspeed or erratic
            control forces often lead to difficulty in making a
            smooth landing (it's also the reason pilots make
            good-humored fun of one another).</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Beginning a Climb</p>

            <p>Flying is no fun if it's all talk and no action. So
            let's take a look at the actions involved in entering a
            climb. Let's assume that your airplane is in
            straight-and-level flight at cruise power with an
            airspeed of 100 knots. Entering the climb requires that
            you raise the nose to climb attitude and simultaneously
            add climb power. After all, it makes sense to get the
            airplane up in the air as fast as is reasonable to take
            advantage of favorable winds and the better view (among
            other reasons). So in the Cessna 172, you'll always add
            full power to climb. Then, you'll apply enough nose-up
            trim to hold the airplane in this attitude.</p>

            <p>As soon as you begin raising the nose, you'll notice
            that the airspeed drops and the vertical speed
            indicator begins to show a climb. This is one sure sign
            that you're climbing. When the people on the ground
            start to look like ants, that's another clue (unless
            you're really looking at ants).</p>

            <p>Figure 3-4 shows the airplane climbing at 85 knots
            and 500 feet per minute.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson3Figure04.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-4</span></td>

            </table>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">You're on Your Way Up</p>

            <p>Engineers (not the kind that drive trains) tell us
            that our Cessna 172 climbs most efficiently at 74
            knots. Since the airplane in Figure 3-4 is at 85 knots,
            how do you get the airplane slowed down to 74 knots
            while continuing to climb at full power?</p>

            <p>The answer is to raise the airplane's nose (increase
            the steepness of the hill you're climbing) to a
            slightly higher climb attitude. Hold it there, and
            watch the response on the airspeed indicator. Adjust
            the pitch up or down slightly until the airspeed
            indicator shows 74 knots (75 is okay, too). Be patient;
            airplanes have inertia and take a moment or two to
            settle into a new speed once the pitch is changed.</p>

            <p>To maintain a 75-knot climb speed, you should show a
            pitch of approximately 13 degrees on the attitude
            indicator, as shown in Figure 3-5</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            </table>

            <p>(For now, we'll use the attitude indicator for our
            pitch and bank reference since it's difficult to see
            the real horizon over the instrument panel in a flight
            simulator.) The attitude indicator's vertical
            calibration lines are worth five degrees each, so you
            read them (from bottom to top) as 5, 10, 15, and 20
            degrees of pitch. Thirteen degrees of pitch would be
            just below the third line up.</p>

            <p>Of course, the pitch for a climb may vary slightly.
            All that matters, however, is that you find the proper
            pitch that gives you the climb airspeed you want.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Care to Waltz?</p>

            <p>Now you know the secret to climbing an airplane.
            Therefore, the next time you want to climb, follow this
            procedure: Raise the nose to approximately 13 degrees
            pitch-up on the attitude indicator, add full throttle,
            and trim the airplane to maintain this attitude. It's
            as simple as that. Then, adjust the pitch slightly
            (perhaps only a degree or two) to give you the airspeed
            you want. Think of entering a climb as a three-step
            waltz. Think: one, two, three&#8230; one, two,
            three&#8230; or attitude, power, trim (unfortunately,
            when I waltz, between every count I'm constantly
            saying, &quot;Oops, sorry about your feet.&quot;). Change the
            attitude, change the power, then trim the airplane once
            it's stabilized at its new attitude.</p>

            <p>Of course, you may elect to climb at a slightly
            faster speed. This often makes it easier to look over
            the instrument panel (so I can see and avoid other
            airplanes). When a rapid, efficient climb to altitude
            isn't necessary, find the airspeed that gives you both
            a good climb rate and a reasonable view over the
            panel.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">What Goes Up...</p>

            <p>If you keep climbing, you'll eventually climb out of
            the atmosphere, right? Not really, but you still need
            to know how to get down (and I don't mean learning to
            dance, either).</p>

            <p>Think of descending in an airplane as you would
            going down a hill in a car. First, as the car points
            down a steep hill, you normally take your foot off the
            accelerator and coast downward. The steepness of the
            hill determines the car's eventual speed. Steep hills
            result in faster coasting speeds, while shallow hills
            result in slower coasting speeds. Airplanes work
            similarly.</p>

            <p>Figure 3-6 shows an airplane with the power reduced
            to flight idle.</p>

            <p>In a sense, this airplane is coasting down a hill.
            The airspeed is stabilized at 80 knots in this figure.
            Now, let's change the steepness of the hill.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Pitch Change Means Airspeed
            Change</p>

            <p>Let's see how a small change in pitch affects the
            airspeed. Without readjusting the trim, if you lower
            the nose slightly (make a steeper hill), you'll find an
            attitude that produces an airspeed reading of 90 knots.
            Do this by referring to the attitude indicator. By
            making a slight pitch adjustment&#8212;perhaps one-half
            of a degree, one degree, or even two degrees&#8212;and
            holding it, you'll notice the airspeed increase.</p>

            <p>Eventually, the airspeed will indicate 90 knots and
            the attitude indicator will show a pitch attitude
            similar to that shown in Figure 3-7.</p>

            <p>If you want to descend at this speed, trim the
            airplane to maintain this attitude.</p>

            <p>If you were to raise the nose (make a shallower
            hill), you would find an attitude that produces an
            airspeed reading of 70 knots. Figure 3-8 shows the
            attitude needed to produce this airspeed.</p>

            <p>This is how you should control the airspeed during a
            descent. Raise or lower the pitch attitude using the
            vertical calibration on the attitude indicator. Make a
            small change, and watch the result. Remember to be
            patient as the airplane slowly changes its speed.</p>

            <p>Controlling your airspeed by adjusting your pitch
            this way is important, especially as you prepare for a
            landing. After all, you'll need to fly at different
            speeds when making your landing approach. By making
            changes in pitch, you can descend at any airspeed you
            want. Just remember to use trim to maintain the
            airplane at the desired attitude and thus, the desired
            airspeed.</p>

            <p>Okay, you've talked me into it. Let's talk just a
            bit about changing descent rates.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Changing Descent Rates</p>

            <p>What if you want to descend at the same airspeed but
            at a slower descent rate (a smaller reading on the
            VSI)? Well, here's your chance for power. (Sorry, I
            mean engine power. No world domination today!) Power
            has a direct bearing on your rate of descent.</p>

            <p>At 80 knots, with the power at flight idle, the
            airplane descends at approximately 700 feet per minute
            (fpm), as shown in Figure 3-9.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Suppose, for example, you're approaching to land and
            need less of a descent rate to make it to the runway.
            What do you do? Increase your power to a higher value,
            say 1800 revolutions per minute (rpm), and adjust the
            pitch slightly to maintain 80 knots. Retrim if
            necessary.</p>

            <p>Your instruments should look like those in Figure
            3-10.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>With this slight increase in power, the airplane
            descends at 300 fpm. Of course, as more power is added,
            the airplane will stop descending. If you give it even
            more power, the airplane will fly level or even start
            climbing at 80 knots.</p>

            <p>At this stage of your training, it's a good time to
            agree on how you'll control the airplane. Power
            (throttle position) should be your means of adjusting
            the rate of descent (what the VSI reads). The
            airplane's pitch attitude (controlled by the joystick)
            is your means of maintaining a specific airspeed. In a
            climb, you'll always use the maximum allowable power
            (usually full throttle) while adjusting the airplane's
            attitude using the joystick for the airspeed desired.
            Since you're familiar with the procedure for making
            climbs and descents, let's combine these with the
            skills we developed in Lesson 2.</p>

                  <p>Figure 3-14 shows a typical altimeter found in
                  most airplanes.</p>

                  <p>It has two hands, and a dot that representing
                  the airplane's height in tens of thousands of
                  feet. The shorter, thicker hand represents
                  altitude in thousands of feet. The long, thin
                  hand represents the airplane's altitude in
                  hundreds of feet.</p>

                  <p>The easiest way to read an altimeter is to
                  read it just like you would a clock. For
                  instance, if Altimeter A in Figure 3-14 were a
                  clock, what time would it read? Yes, it would
                  read 3 o'clock. Since Altimeter A isn't a clock,
                  it shows an altitude of 3,000 feet. The long
                  (hundreds) hand points to zero hundred feet, and
                  the medium (thousands) hand points to 3,000
                  feet.</p>

                  <p>If Altimeter B were a clock, what time would
                  it say? It would read 3:30, or half past 3
                  o'clock. As an altimeter, it reads half past
                  three thousand, or 3,500 feet. The long
                  (hundreds) hand points to 500 feet, and the
                  medium (thousands) hand points to between 3,000
                  and 4,000 feet. Thus, the altitude is 500 feet
                  past 3,000 feet (3,500 feet).</p>

                  <p>What time would it be if Altimeter C were a
                  clock? It looks like it would be somewhere around
                  a quarter to seven. More precisely, the long
                  (hundreds) hand shows 800 feet, and the medium
                  (thousands) hand points a little shy of 7,000
                  feet. Therefore, the altimeter reads 800 feet
                  past 6,000 feet (6,800 feet). Not too tough, is
                  it?</p>

                  <p>Try reading Altimeter D like a clock. What
                  time is it? Yes, it looks like it's 3:00, but
                  take a closer look at the very small dot. This
                  dot points a little past a value of 1, meaning
                  you need to add 10,000 feet onto the value shown
                  by the altimeter's medium and long hands. Thus,
                  Altimeter D indicates an altitude of 13,000
                  feet.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Things Are Turning Up</p>

            <p>Suppose we want to combine climbs and descents with
            turns. Specifically, let's examine how to enter a
            20-degree right-banking turn while established in a
            climb, then roll into straight-and-level flight. Here's
            how you might do it.</p>

            <p>First, establish the climb. Increase the pitch to a
            13-degree nose-up attitude, as shown in Figure 3-11,
            add full power, and then trim.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson3Figure11.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-11</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Then, you'll roll into the desired bank. The secret
            here is to use the attitude indicator's orange ball as
            the pitch reference. Since the orange wings won't be
            aligned with the horizon, use the orange ball as a
            pitch reference, and use the attitude indicator's
            orange pointer as the bank reference.</p>

            <p>When climbing (descending, too), it's best to begin
            leveling off when you're within 50 feet of your desired
            altitude. A 50-foot lead helps prevent overshooting or
            undershooting the target altitude. If you want to level
            off at 4,000 feet, then enter level flight when you
            read 3,950 on your altimeter. At this point, you'd
            lower the nose and roll out into a straight-and-level
            flight attitude.</p>

            <p>Yes, the power is still set at maximum, and that's
            good. Let the airplane accelerate to cruise speed
            (unless you specifically want to fly at a slower
            speed). Then reduce power to a cruise setting of
            approximately 2,200 rpm.</p>

            <p>Once the airspeed stabilizes, trim for this
            attitude, as shown in Figure 3-12.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>Well, that's how you do it. Believe it or not, that
            wasn't necessarily a simple maneuver. Remember, the
            secret to going from one attitude to another (such as
            from straight-and-level flight to a climb) is to do it
            like a waltz: one, two, three&#8230; Attitude, power,
            and trim. You adjust the attitude to a known value that
            puts your airplane in the ballpark for a climb (13
            degrees for a climb at 80 knots). Then you adjust the
            power (you'll climb with full power in our lessons'
            airplane). And finally, you provide enough trim to hold
            this attitude. The formula of attitude, power, and trim
            is the secret when making any pitch change.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Time for a Turn Down</p>

            <p>Suppose you're flying at 4,000 feet and want to
            descend to 2,500 feet while in a left turn at 20
            degrees of bank. To make this maneuver a little more
            challenging, do it at 90 knots. Here's how it's
            done.</p>

            <p>First, you roll into a 20-degree turn to the left.
            Then, you reduce power to flight idle. (Flight idle is
            the condition where the throttle is pull aft to its
            stop and the engine produces idle power.)</p>

            <p>Next, you lower the nose to an attitude that you
            suspect gives you an airspeed of 90 knots. (You'll
            notice that when you reduce power, the nose will
            automatically want to lower on its own. Therefore,
            you'll probably have to apply a little back pressure on
            the joystick to keep it from descending too quickly.)
            Since 3 degrees positive (upward) pitch gives you 80
            knots, perhaps you attain 90 knots at 1 degree positive
            pitch (a slightly lower attitude). Remember, because
            you're in a turn, you use the attitude indicator's
            orange ball as the pitch reference, as shown in Figure
            3-13.</p>

            <p>When you're at 2,550 feet (a 50-foot lead above
            2,500), put the airplane in the attitude for
            straight-and-level flight. Then, you increase power to
            a cruise setting of 2300 rpm, and trim when the

                  airplane propellers are nothing more than big
                  pinwheels for big kids. The pinwheel effect is
                  responsible for rpm (revolutions per minute)
                  values that change from their preset positions as
                  the airspeed changes. For instance, whenever you
                  set the throttle to a new rpm value, the rpm
                  reading will change as the airplane's airspeed
                  changes. Why? The propeller reacts to changing
                  airspeed like a pinwheel reacts to wind. This
                  spins the prop artificially fast or prevents it
                  from spinning to its full potential until the
                  airspeed stabilizes. This often requires
                  resetting the rpm once, or perhaps twice, to
                  achieve the final setting you want. The pinwheel
                  effect is associated with fixed-pitch propellers
                  (which is the kind like the one on the airplane
                  that we use for our lessons). Later on, you'll
                  learn about constant-speed propellers that change
                  their pitch to maintain a specific rpm.</p>
