            </div>

            <p class="deck">&#8211; by Rod Machado</p>

            <p>We often use mechanical equipment without completely
            understanding how it works.</p>

            <p>As a young bachelor, my parents gave me a vacuum
            cleaner for my birthday. Several months later, Mom
            called and asked, &quot;Are you having trouble finding bags
            for your vacuum cleaner?&quot; I said, &quot;Bags? What
            bags?&quot;</p>

            <p>How was I to know the thing needed bags?</p>

            <p>Technological ignorance has its advantages, but not
            when you're up in the air. You don't need a Ph.D. in
            aerodynamics to be a pilot, but a moderate-to-decent
            understanding of why an airplane stays airborne will
            prove helpful and life-sustaining. That's why this
            first ground school class is the longest. Don't worry;
            you won't need to have your eyeballs recapped after
            reading it. But I do want you to read it all the way
            through. In order to fly a plane, you must first fill
            your brain (with a little bit of information, at
            least). This class is the place to start. Read, and be
            happy because this is an investment that will pay off
            big-time.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">May the Four Forces Be With You</p>

            <p>No, the four forces isn't a 1960s rock group. These
            forces are actually the things that pull and push on an
            airplane in flight. The four forces&#8212;lift, weight,
            thrust, and drag&#8212;are present any and every time a
            plane is airborne. Look at Figure 1-1, which shows the
            action of the four forces.</p>

            <p>Of course, enormous arrows don't really protrude
            from the airplane. I know this will disappoint those of
            you who still expect the states to be colored blue and
            red and have lines drawn around their borders as you
            fly over them, but you'll get used to it. The arrows do
            serve to show that what we've got here is a highly
            competitive new game&#8212;four-way tug-of-war. Your
            job as pilot is to manage the resources available in
            order to balance these forces. Let's see what they're
            all about.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lift</p>

            <p>Lift is the upward-acting force created when an
            airplane's wings move through the air. Forward movement
            produces a slight difference in pressure between the
            wings' upper and lower surfaces. This difference
            becomes lift. It's lift that keeps an airplane
            airborne.</p>

            <p>I discovered how lift works at four years of age
            during my first visit to church. The collection plate
            passed in front of me, and I picked out a few shiny
            items. My grandfather chased me around the pew, and I
            thought, &quot;Wow, church is fun!&quot; Picking me up by my
            sweater, Grandpa held me suspended four feet off the
            ground and toted me outside. It was the lift from
            Grandpa's arm, precisely equaling my weight, that kept
            me airborne. Wings do for the airplane what Grandpa's
            arm did for me&#8212;provide the lift to remain
            aloft.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Weight</p>

            <p>Weight is the downward-acting force. It's the one
            force pilots control to some extent by choosing how
            they load the airplane. With the exception of fuel
            burn, the airplane's actual weight is difficult to
            change in flight. Once airborne, you should not be
            burning cargo or acquiring extra passengers (or losing
            them for that matter). Unexpected discharge of
            passengers while in flight is a violation of some FAA
            rule, so please don't do it.</p>

            <p>In unaccelerated flight (when the airplane's speed
            and direction are constant), the opposing forces of
            lift and weight are in balance.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Thrust and Drag</p>

            <p>Thrust is a forward-acting force produced by an
            engine-spun propeller. For the most part, the bigger
            the engine (meaning more horsepower), the greater the
            thrust produced and the faster the airplane can
            fly&#8212;up to a point. Forward movement always
            generates an aerodynamic penalty called drag. Drag
            pulls rearward on the airplane and is simply the
            atmosphere's molecular resistance to motion through it.
            In plain English (which pilots and engineers rarely
            use), it's wind resistance. Few things are free with
            Mother Nature. As a buddy of mine likes to say: &quot;If
            you're getting something for nothing, you're not using
            your own credit card.&quot;</p>

            <p>Thrust causes the airplane to accelerate, but drag
            determines its final speed. As the airplane's velocity
            increases, its drag also increases. Due to the
            perversity of nature, doubling the airplane's speed
            actually quadruples the drag. Eventually, the rearward
            pull of drag equals the engine's thrust, and a constant
            speed is attained.</p>

            <p>My high school Volkswagen Beetle knew these limits
            well. The Bug's forward speed is limited by its engine
            size. With four little cylinders (only three of which
            worked at any one time), this VW simply wouldn't go
            faster than 65 mph. Figure 1-2 shows the results of
            maximum thrust meeting the equal and rearward pull of
            drag at this speed.</p>

            <p>Maintaining a slower speed requires less power,
            since less drag exists. At any speed less than the
            maximum forward speed of the car, excess thrust
            (horsepower) is available for other uses, such as
            accelerating around other cars or perhaps powering a
            portable calliope if you are so inclined.</p>

            <p>The same is true of airplanes. At less-than-maximum
            speed in level flight, there's power (thrust) to spare.
            Excess thrust can be applied to perform one of
            aviation's most important maneuvers&#8212;the
            climb.</p>

            <p>With this introduction complete, I think it's time
            for you to learn a little about the airplane's flight
            controls.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Flight Controls</p>

            <p>If you're ready-made pilot material, you've been
            patiently licking your chops waiting for the discussion
            on flight controls. Gandhi would applaud your patience
            (but Gandhi isn't here, so I will). Figure 1-3 shows
            the three imaginary axes of the airplane.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
            class="LessonFigureTable" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

                an airplane.<br>

                3-Lateral Axis (pitch)<br></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>By use of the flight controls, the airplane can be
            made to rotate about one or more of these axes. The
            <strong>longitudinal</strong>, or long, <strong>axis</strong> runs through
            the centerline of the airplane from nose to tail.
            Airplanes roll, or bank, about their longitudinal axis.
            A good way to remember which way the longitudinal axis
            runs is to remember that it's a long (as in
            longitudinal) way from the nose to the tail of an
            airplane.</p>

            <p>A sideways pass in football is called a lateral
            pass. Similarly, the <strong>lateral axis</strong> runs sideways
            through the airplane from wingtip to wingtip. Airplanes
            pitch about their lateral axis.</p>

            <p>The <strong>vertical axis</strong> of the airplane runs up and
            down from the cockpit to the belly. Airplanes yaw about
            their vertical axis. Think of yawing motion as yawning
            motion. In the morning, you yawn by standing and
            stretching vertically, rotating right and left, waiting
            for those vertebrae to kick in.</p>

            <p>Now we're ready to examine each of the three main
            flight controls that cause an airplane to move about
            its axes.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ailerons</p>

            <p>Ailerons are the moveable surfaces on the outer
            trailing edges of the wings. Their purpose is to bank
            the airplane in the direction you want to turn. When
            the control wheel is turned to the right, as shown in
            Figure 1-4, the ailerons simultaneously move in
            opposite directions (this doesn't mean they're broken,
            either).</p>

            decreasing the lift on the right wing. This causes the
            airplane to bank to the right.</p>

            <p>When the control wheel is turned to the left, as
            shown in Figure 1-5, the left wing aileron raises,
            decreasing the lift on the left wing.</p>

            <p>Ailerons allow one wing to develop more lift and the
            other to develop less. Differential lift banks the
            airplane, which tilts the total lifting force in the
            direction you want to turn.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Elevator</p>

            <p>The elevator is the moveable horizontal surface at
            the rear of the airplane. Its purpose is to pitch the
            airplane's nose up or down (Figure 1-6)</p>

                  Pressure?&quot;</p>

                  <p>&quot;Applying back pressure&quot; is another one of
                  those terms that sounds strange to non-pilots. It
                  doesn't mean you'll be giving your instructor
                  some sort of in-flight massage (as nice an idea
                  as that may be). Rather, it refers to the action
                  when a pilot pulls back&#8212;gently&#8212;on the
                  airplane's control wheel. The phrase probably
                  came about as the result of an instructor who
                  realized that novice students have a tendency to
                  take the phrase &quot;pull back on the wheel&quot; a little
                  too literally and yanked the wheel back
                  hard&#8230; a maneuver I don't recommend.</p>

            <p>The elevator control works on the same aerodynamic
            principle as the aileron. Applying back pressure on the
            control wheel of the airplane, as shown in Figure 1-6,
            deflects the elevator surface upward.</p>

            <p>Lower pressure is created on the underside of the
            tail, which moves it downward, and the nose of the
            airplane pitches up.</p>

            <p>The airplane in Figure 1-7 shows what happens when
            the control wheel is moved forward.</p>

            <p>The elevator surface moves down, thus creating lower
            pressure on the top side of the tail and causes the
            tail to rise. The nose rotates about the lateral axis
            in a downward direction. Simply stated, to pitch up,
            pull the control wheel back; to pitch down, move the
            control wheel forward.</p>

            <p>There's also a third flight control, the rudder,
            which controls yaw around the vertical axis. We'll
            discuss this later on, but for now, I want to make sure
            you know I didn't forget about it.</p>

            <p>Now that you've acquired a basic idea of how the
            flight controls work, let's put our brain in the plane
            and discuss how to perform a useful flight maneuver:
            straight-and-level flight.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Straight-and-Level Flight</p>

            <p>You're about to practice straight-and-level flight,
            one of aviation's most fundamental maneuvers. Does this
            sound like two separate maneuvers instead of one? Well,
            it is. Straight flight means the airplane's nose
            remains pointed in one direction and the wings are
            parallel to the earth's horizon. Level flight means the
            airplane doesn't gain or lose altitude.</p>

            <p>Figure 1-8 shows what straight-and-level flight
            looks like from the left seat where you, the pilot,
            normally sit.</p>

            <p>Don't worry if the picture shows us headed for a
            distant mountain. I'm with you, and I'm good at
            avoiding mountains. In fact, it's my specialty.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How to Tell You're Going
            Straight</p>

            <p>Okay, how do you know you're actually flying
            straight and level? The easiest way to tell is to look
            over the instrument panel and out the windscreen (the
            front window), as shown in Figure 1-8. It appears that
            the top portion of the instrument panel is
            approximately parallel with the earth's distant
            horizon. This implies that your wings are not banked,
            which means you're flying straight ahead and not
            turning.</p>

            <p>There is, however, another way to tell if you're
            flying straight. You can press the hat switch on your
            joystick. (The hat switch is the button that sticks
            straight up out of the middle, near your thumb) If you
            look out the left or right window, as shown in Figure
            1-9, you'll notice the position of each wing relative
            to the earth's horizon.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>In straight flight, both wings should be the same
            distance above the horizon (refer to the horizon, not
            the mountains).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Having the Right Attitude</p>

            <p>In real airplanes, I prefer that my students almost
            strip the gears in their neck by looking right and left
            out the windows. This helps them check the wing's
            position and keeps their eyes focused out the cockpit
            looking for traffic. No, I don't mean automobile
            traffic, either. I mean airplane traffic. In the
            simulator, however, it's inconvenient to keep shifting
            views to the left and to the right. So you'll use the
            attitude indicator to help maintain straight-and-level
            flight. The attitude indicator is located at the top of
            the six main flight instruments directly in front of
            you (Figure 1-10).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>The attitude indicator is an artificial
            representation of the real horizon. Just as its name
            suggests, the attitude indicator displays the
            airplane's attitude (its upward or downward pitch and
            the bank the wings make with the horizon). The upper
            half of the attitude indicator is blue (like the real
            sky, unless, of course, you fly in Los Angeles), the
            bottom half is brown (like the surface below us). The
            thin white line between these colors is the artificial
            horizon line. Pilots use the attitude indicator when
            they can't see the earth's horizon because of
            restrictions to visibility or when it's inconvenient to
            look at the wing tips (which will usually be your
            situation when flying the simulator).</p>

            <p>By moving the joystick to the left, the airplane
            banks to the left, which dips the left wing downward
            toward the ground, as shown in Figure 1-11A.</p>

            <p>This is how you begin a left turn. Notice that the
            miniature (orange-winged) airplane in the attitude
            indicator also appears to dip its left wing toward the
            ground. Mechanically speaking, it's really the
            background of the attitude indicator that moves and
            creates a picture of the airplane's attitude.
            Nevertheless, you can always tell which way you're
            banking by determining which one of the small orange
            wings in the attitude indicator dips toward the ground.
            (This is easy since you only have two choices).</p>

            <p>By gently moving the joystick to the right in the
            same manner just described, the attitude indicator will
            indicate a right turn. Now the orange-winged plane's
            right wing dips toward the ground, as shown in Figure
            1-11B. Moving the joystick to the right or left until
            both of the miniature plane's wings are parallel to the
            artificial horizon line returns the joystick to its
            center (default) position and returns the airplane to
            straight flight, as shown in Figure 1-11C. After all,
            if the wings aren't banked, the airplane isn't
            turning.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Know Where You're Heading</p>

            <p>There is one more way to know if you're flying
            straight. This involves using the airplane's heading
            indicator, as shown in Figure 1-12.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            </table>

            <p>Figure 1-12 shows the airplane's heading indicator
            (sometimes called the directional gyro). It's found in
            the middle of the bottom row of the six main flight
            instruments that we'll be discussing soon. Think of the
            heading indicator as a mechanical compass that shows
            which way your airplane points. Notice the numbers on
            the face of the heading indicator. Add a single zero to
            any number on the face to get the airplane's actual
            heading. In other words, 6 is really a heading of 60
            degrees (spoken as zero-six-zero degrees). The number
            33 is actually a heading of 330 degrees. (When we say
            that aloud, we say &quot;three-three-zero degrees&quot; for extra
            clarity. It's important to be extra clear when you're
            flying.) These numbers appear at 30-degree intervals.
            Between these numbers are 5- and 10-degree heading
            increments.</p>

            <p>To fly a specific heading, simply turn the airplane
            in the shortest direction to the heading desired. For
            example, turn the airplane until the nose of the
            airplane in the heading indicator points to the letter
            W for west (this is a heading of 270 degrees). Of
            course, if the heading remains constant, then you're
            flying straight and thus, not turning. This is another
            way to identify that you're flying straight.</p>

            <p>Now that you understand the straight portion of
            straight-and-level flight, let's move on to the level
            portion of this maneuver.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Making Sure You're on the Level</p>

            <p>Let's talk about what happens to your altitude when
            you pitch the airplane's nose up or down. When you
            pitch the airplane up by applying back pressure on the
            joystick, the attitude indicator's miniature airplane
            also points upward toward the sky (the blue), as shown
            in Figure 1-13A. The attitude indicator's vertical
            calibration lines are worth five degrees each, so you
            read them (from bottom to top) as 5, 10, 15, and 20
            degrees of pitch.</p>

            <p>Look at the altimeter, which is located directly to
            the right of the attitude indicator (Figure 1-13B). The
            biggest hand (the hundred-foot hand) will normally move
            clockwise when the nose is raised. And, just like the
            hands of a watch, clockwise movement means something is
            increasing. In this case, it's your altitude.</p>

            <p>Directly below the altimeter is the vertical speed
            indicator (VSI). Its needle also deflects upward when
            you pitch the airplane's nose up, showing a rate of
            climb (Figure 1-13C). These are additional indications
            that you're climbing and not maintaining level
            flight.</p>

            <p>When the joystick is returned to its center
            position, the airplane will begin to settle back into
            level flight (assuming the airplane is properly
            trimmed&#8212;we'll talk about this shortly).</p>

            <p>When you pitch the airplane downward, the attitude
            indicator's miniature airplane points toward the
            surface (the brown color), as shown in Figure 14.</p>

            <p>The altimeter's hands will begin to unwind (rotate
            counterclockwise), indicating a loss of altitude. The
            VSI will also show a rate of descent as its needle
            deflects downward. It's safe to say that if the big
            hand of the altimeter stops moving and the VSI needle
            indicates zero, then you're in level flight. In fact,
            this is precisely how pilots confirm that their
            airplane is in level flight.</p>

            <p>It takes practice to keep these needles stationary
            (in real life, they're always moving just a tiny bit).
            The average private pilot does a great job if he or she
            remains within 100 feet of a chosen altitude.
            Unfortunately, when I was a student, I found it much
            easier to keep changing the target altitude at which I
            wanted to be (until, of course, I finally perfected
            this skill).</p>

            <p>In the Interactive Lesson, you'll practice
            maintaining a straight course by keeping the attitude
            indicator's miniature airplane (the orange wings)
            parallel to the artificial horizon line. If a wing dips
            right or left, you'll raise it by moving the joystick
            in the opposite direction.</p>

            <p>You'll also get some practice at maintaining level
            flight by keeping the altimeter's hundred-foot hand
            stationary. It shouldn't move. If it does, then you'll
            use the joystick to change the pitch slightly until it
            stops moving. This will be the pitch attitude required
            for level flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Time for a Trim?</p>

            <p>Airplanes are subject to an assortment of
            aerodynamic forces. Some try to pitch the nose up;
            others try to pitch it down. Engine power, weight
            placement, and lift are just a few of these forces.
            What does this mean to you? Well, if the airplane wants
            to pitch forward, you can't sit there pulling back on
            the joystick for the entire flight. Applying continuous
            pressure on the control wheel to maintain pitch
            attitude means your arms would tire quickly (your
            personal trainer would be proud of you, but I
            wouldn't). Fortunately, airplanes have something known
            as a trim tab to take the pressure off the control
            wheel (and off the pilot!). Let's look at how the trim
            tab works, and then we'll talk about how to use it.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Trim Tabs Work</p>

            <p>A trim tab is a small, moveable surface attached to
            the main surface you want to control (in this case,
            it's the elevator). Figure 1-15A shows the trim tab and
            the trim wheel that's used to change the trim tab's
            position. In the real airplane, the wheel is usually
            located between the two front seats or on the lower
            portion of the instrument panel.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="SummaryTBD">

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Moving the trim tab creates a slight pressure
            difference on the end of the control surface to which
            it's attached. Just enough pressure is created to keep
            the primary control surface in the desired position
            without having to hold the control wheel in place.
            Notice that the trim tab moves in a direction opposite
            to the primary control surface it affects. If you want
            the elevator to deflect upward (as if you're pulling
            back on the wheel in a climb), the trim tab must move
            down, as shown by Elevator A in Figure 1-15A.</p>

            <p>To maintain a downward deflection of the elevator
            (as if you're in a descent), the trim tab must move
            upward, as shown by Elevator B in Figure 1-15B.</p>

            <p>Think of trim as an imaginary hand that holds the
            airplane in the desired attitude while eliminating the
            pressure you apply to the joystick. The trim control
            may be found on your joystick in the form of small
            wheels or buttons.</p>

            <p>If you don't have a trim button on your joystick,
            you can use two keys on the number pad to trim the
            airplane for the proper pitch attitude. The <strong>END</strong>
            key provides nose-up trim, and the <strong>HOME</strong> key
            provides nose-down trim.</p>

            <p>Here's how you should trim an airplane for straight
            and level flight. First, check to see if the airplane
            is already properly trimmed. Do this by easing up on
            the pressure being applied to the joystick. Then, watch
            the VSI's needle. If the needle shows a climb (rotates
            upward), the airplane needs nose-down trim. Apply a
            little forward pressure on the joystick to return to
            level flight, then press <strong>HOME</strong> once for a little
            nose-down trim (or use the nose-down trim button). Once
            done, release the pressure on the joystick and see what
            happens.</p>

            <p>The more you push the trim button, the more trim you
            apply. So be patient. You may have to repeat this same
            process several times until the VSI's needle remains
            relatively horizontal, near the zero climb-rate
            value.</p>

            <p>If the VSI's needle shows a descent (rotates
            downward), apply a little back pressure on the joystick
            to return the airplane to level flight. Then press
            <strong>END</strong> on the number pad a few times for nose-up
            trim (or use the nose-up trim button). Once done,
            release the pressure on the joystick and watch the
            VSI's needle response. Repeat the process as necessary
            until the airplane neither climbs nor descends.</p>

            <p>I prefer to use the VSI's needle for trimming, since
            it's very sensitive. I don't mean that it will cry if
            you tell it that it's ugly. I mean that its needle is
            sensitive to small changes in pitch. This makes it
            easier to detect deviations from level flight. In a
            future lesson, I'll show you how to use the VSI's
            needle for trimming in a climb or descent.</p>

            <p>Many airplanes have trim for bank control, called
            aileron trim. You may even have this as part of your
            joystick assembly. Bank trim is sometimes necessary
            when the wing's fuel load is unbalanced or if you have
            heavier passengers sitting to one side of the
            airplane.</p>

            <p>Regardless of how well the airplane is trimmed, it
            may oscillate up or down slightly, varying its altitude
            by perhaps 100 feet up or down. That's the way
            airplanes are. Each one likes to do its own thing and
            may vary slightly in altitude and heading even when
            properly trimmed. Let them go, unless they wander too
            far off. Your job is to make the airplane as easy as
            possible to fly so you have more time to think, plan,
            plot, and scheme your way to safe simulator flying.</p>

            <p>You should be proud of yourself for accomplishing
            your first ground school session. Hey, I'm proud of
            you! Now it's time for some interactive flight
            training.</p>
