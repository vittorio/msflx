            Student Pilot Lessons
          </div>

          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>The first step in learning to fly in Flight
            Simulator is to learn the fundamentals of controlling
            the aircraft. As you look at the order of the lessons,
            it may seem odd that the takeoff lesson is not first.
            That's simply because the prerequisite skills for
            taking off involve an understanding of how to control
            the aircraft once it's in the air. The training in
            these lessons serves as the foundation for having fun
            in Flight Simulator. There's a lot more training
            available after these lessons. However, if all you want
            to do is fly, they teach the most basic skills you'll
            need. You'll fly a Cessna 172, which is a proven
            trainer aircraft. Have fun!</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Student Pilot</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 1: Straight and level
            flight</p>

            <p>Learn how the controls of the airplane change what
            the airplane is doing. Your task in this lesson is to
            learn how to keep the airplane in level flight and
            flying in the same direction.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 2: Turns</p>

            <p>Navigating to your destination requires you to turn.
            Here's where you learn this important and fun
            skill.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 3: Climbs and descents</p>

            <p>Learn to climb to your cruise altitude, and more
            importantly, learn how to get back down so you can
            land&#8212;or have a closer look at the nice scenery
            below you.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 4: Slow flight</p>

            <p>Learning to control the airplane at slow speeds is
            critical to a good landing. The best way to develop
            that skill is to learn about operating the airplane
            just above stall speed&#8212;the airspeed at which the
            wings no longer produce enough lift to fly. It's not as
            scary as it sounds.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 5: Takeoffs</p>

            <p>Learn how to accelerate down the runway and become
            airborne. There's not much more to it than that, except
            that once you're airborne, you have to use all the
            skills you've previously learned to keep the airplane
            in the air.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 6: Landings</p>

            <p>It all comes together when you learn to land the
            airplane. This two-part lesson first brings you down to
            the runway by having you fly through hoops in the sky.
            In the second lesson, the hoops are gone, and you'll
            learn about the other devices you can use to help you
            judge what to do to land the airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 7: Your First Solo</p>

            <p>Your instructor will step out of the airplane and
            ask you to fly around the pattern by yourself. He'll be
            talking to you on the radio to help you fly around the
            pattern&#8212;something you'll learn to do on your own
            in a later lesson. But for this flight, take off,
            climb, level off, turn, descend, and land as instructed
            throughout the flight, and you will earn your Flight
            Simulator Solo Certificate.</p>
