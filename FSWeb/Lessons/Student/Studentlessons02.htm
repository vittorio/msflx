              How Airplanes Turn
            </div>

            <p class="deck">&#8212;by Rod Machado</p>

            <p>There are many misconceptions in aviation. For
            instance, there are pilots who think propwash is a
            highly specialized detergent. And a select few think
            that when an instructor says, &quot;Okay, taxi,&quot; that they
            should call a cab.</p>

            <p>As a young student pilot, an FAA inspector asked me
            how an airplane turns. I looked at him and said, &quot;With
            the wheel, sir.&quot; He clutched his chest and shook his
            head in disbelief. I admit that my answer was a little
            off and that he was a tad upset (the foam around his
            mouth, and his eyebrows merging with his hairline were
            good clues). Just so you don't have any of these
            problems, let's examine what causes an airplane to turn
            and then look at how you can perform this nifty little
            maneuver.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Lightness of Lift</p>

            <p>Airplane A in Figure 2-1 shows a view of an airplane
            in straight-and-level flight.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson2Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-1 How an Airplane
                Turns.<br>
                Banking the airplane causes the lift force to
                tilt,<br>
                which pulls the airplane in the direction of the
                bank.<br>
                Technically, it's the horizontal component of<br>
                the lift force that makes the airplane
                turn.<br></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>From this vantage point, lift acts vertically,
            pulling upward on the airplane and keeping it suspended
            in flight. Of course, if lift can pull upward, it can
            also pull a little to the left or right. When it does
            this, the airplane turns.</p>

            <p>Airplane B in Figure 2-1 shows the total lift force
            on a banked airplane. Part of the lift force pulls the
            airplane up (the vertical component of lift), and part
            pulls the airplane in the direction of the turn (the
            horizontal component of lift). You can use your
            imagination and visualize two separate and smaller
            forces making up the total lifting force. (There are
            those crazy arrows again. You will not see these on a
            real airplane, so enjoy them while you can.) The arrows
            represent the forces of lift.</p>

            <p>Always remember that it's the horizontal component
            that causes an airplane to turn&#8212;it pulls the
            airplane in an arc. Therefore, the larger the angle of
            bank, the greater the horizontal component and the
            quicker the airplane can turn.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Turns: Maneuvers You Can Bank On</p>

            <p>Now that you know what makes an airplane turn, let
            me play the role of Socrates, the philosopher, and ask
            you an important question. (Don't mind the bed sheet
            I'm dressed in. If, however, I show up wrapped in a
            mattress, that means we're ready to practice landings.)
            The question is, &quot;How do we tilt lift so as to make the
            airplane turn?&quot;</p>

            <p>The answer is, &quot;With the ailerons.&quot;</p>

            <p>If you said, &quot;With the wheel,&quot; I promise not to have
            a heart attack. In fact, turning the wheel or
            deflecting the joystick (that is, banking the airplane
            using ailerons) is exactly how we tilt the total
            lifting force and start a turn.</p>

            <p>To turn, deflect the joystick (when I say deflect, I
            mean to move it slowly to the right or left) in the
            desired direction of the turn and roll the airplane
            until reaching the desired bank angle. Then, return the
            joystick to its neutral (center) position, and the
            airplane usually remains established at this bank
            angle. If the airplane drifts from the desired bank,
            give the joystick a nudge or two to maintain the bank
            angle.</p>

            <p>Let me roll myself up in that sheet and play
            Socrates again by asking, &quot;From the inside of the
            cockpit, how can you tell how steeply you're banking?&quot;
            After all, you can't have another pilot follow you
            around just to tell you what your bank is. Here's a
            better way.</p>

            <p>Figure 2-2 shows the attitude indicator that we
            learned about earlier.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson2Figure02.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-2</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>At the top of the attitude indicator, immediately to
            the right and left of center, are three white bank
            marks. Each mark indicates 10 degrees of bank, up to 30
            degrees. Beyond the 30-degree mark are the 60-degree
            and 90-degree bank marks. To establish a 30-degree
            bank, roll the airplane until a white bank mark (the
            third one from the top) rests over the little orange
            triangle.</p>

            <p>Not too tough, is it? But what if you want to bank
            at 15 or 45 degrees? Here's how it's done: Figure 2-3
            shows two white diagonal lines angled downward from the
            middle of the attitude indicator.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson2Figure03.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>These are bank lines for 15 and 45 degrees of bank,
            respectively. If you roll the airplane to the right
            until the attitude indicator's miniature airplane (the
            one with little orange wings) is parallel to the first
            diagonal line, as shown in Figure 2-3B, then you're in
            a 15-degree bank. A 45-degree bank is accomplished by
            gently rolling the airplane until the miniature
            airplane's wings are parallel to the second diagonal
            line.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Compensating for Gravity and
            Drag</p>

            <p>Now there's one more thing you need to understand
            before you're ready to proceed to the Interactive
            Lesson on turns.</p>

            <p>In aviation, it's important to remember that you
            never get something for nothing. This is especially
            true when making turns.</p>

            <p>Tilting the total lift force while in a turn means
            less lift is available to act vertically against the
            airplane's weight (refer back to Airplane B in Figure
            2-1). The airplane responds by moving in the direction
            of the momentarily larger force&#8212;downward, in the
            direction of the weight. We compensate for this by
            increasing our lift slightly whenever we enter a turn.
            This is done by applying a little back pressure on the
            joystick (that's back pressure on the joystick, not
            pressure you generate on your back by digging your
            heels into the airplane's carpet). Later on, you'll
            understand that back pressure increases the wing's
            angle of attack, thereby increasing the wing's lift
            slightly. Unfortunately, this increase in angle of
            attack also increases the drag, which slows the
            airplane down. In a shallow-banked turn (somewhere
            around 30 degrees or less), this decrease in speed
            isn't a concern. Steeper turns (45 degrees or more) may
            require the addition of power to prevent the airspeed
            from decreasing too much.</p>

            <p>Let's take a look at the attitude indicator again
            and see how we can use it to help us calibrate the
            amount of back pressure we will use when entering a
            turn.</p>

            <p>Observe the position of the attitude indicator's
            miniature airplane (especially the orange ball between
            the wings). In straight-and-level flight, the miniature
            airplane (and orange ball) rests almost directly over
            the artificial horizon line, as shown in Figure
            2-4.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson2Figure04.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-4 Mini-airplane<br>
                rests almost on<br>
                horizon bar in<br>
                straight and level flight<br></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In a bank, however, it's hard to identify the
            airplane's pitch on the attitude indicator since the
            miniature airplane is no longer aligned with the
            artificial horizon line. Therefore, use the position of
            the orange ball in relation to the artificial horizon
            line as a pitch reference in a turn.</p>

            <p>In order to hold altitude in a 15-degree and a
            30-degree bank turn, you must slightly increase the
            airplane's pitch. Figure 2-5 gives you a basic idea of
            how much this pitch must increase.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson2Figure05.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-5</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The point you want to remember is that steeper turns
            require an increase in pitch to maintain altitude. When
            rolling out of a turn back into straight flight, you
            must release the back pressure, thus reducing the pitch
            to that required for level flight. You'll learn more
            about why we must increase the pitch in a turn in the
            upcoming section on slow flight. For now, when rolling
            into or out of a turn, make whatever pitch-up
            adjustment is necessary to maintain altitude. In
            steeper turns, be prepared to pull back a little more
            on the joystick to keep the VSI's needle reading zero
            and the altimeter's big (hundred-foot) hand steady. Use
            the orange ball's position relative to the artificial
            horizon line to determine the airplane's pitch while
            banked. And remember to lower the pitch when returning
            to straight-and-level flight.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Using the Rudder</p>

            <p>The rudder is the moveable vertical surface located
            at the rear of the airplane. Its purpose is to keep the
            airplane's nose pointed in the direction of the
            turn&#8212;not to turn the airplane! Remember,
            airplanes turn by banking. The rudder simply corrects
            for the forces that want to twist the airplane in a
            direction other than the direction it wants to turn
            (there are several forces that do this, but we won't
            discuss them here. If you'd like to do a little extra
            credit, read the sidebar titled &quot;Extra Credit: Adverse
            Yaw&quot;).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
            class="note" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <p class="SubHead2">Extra Credit: Adverse Yaw</p>

                  <p>Adverse yaw is the reason airplanes are
                  equipped with rudders. When banking to the right,
                  the aileron on the left wing lowers, causing that
                  wing to lift up. While the lowered aileron
                  increases the lift on the left wing, it also
                  causes a slight increase in drag.</p>

                  <p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you say, &quot;I didn't order any
                  drag with my lift.&quot; True, but this isn't a pizza,
                  either. Mother Nature always accompanies lift
                  with a little drag&#8212;like a chaperone on a
                  high school date (which would be a real
                  drag).</p>

                  <p>In a right turn, the aileron on the left wing
                  goes down to lift that wing. The wing rises, but
                  the slight increase in drag pulls the left wing
                  aft a little. This has the effect of pulling (or
                  yawing) the airplane's nose adversely to the left
                  as the airplane banks to the right.</p>

                  <p>Obviously, if you're banked to the right, you
                  want the nose to point in the same direction
                  you're banking, don't you? This is where rudders
                  come in handy (although we use our feet to push
                  on them). By keeping the ball in the inclinometer
                  centered, you're properly correcting for adverse
                  yaw. In this condition, the airplane is being
                  flown with the proper coordination.</p>

                  <p>Remember, adverse yaw affects the airplane as
                  it rolls into or out of a bank. Therefore, more
                  rudder pressure is needed when rolling into or
                  out of a bank. Once you're established in a turn,
                  you often can neutralize the rudder and the nose
                  should remain pointed in the direction you're
                  headed. (Later, you'll learn about situations in
                  which it's necessary to keep a little rudder
                  pressure applied in a turn.)</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator comes with an Autorudder feature
            that keeps the nose pointed in the proper direction
            when making a turn. Therefore, if you don't have rudder
            pedals, this simulated airplane will always fly
            coordinated. In other words, an appropriate amount of
            rudder will always accompany any aileron input. Of
            course, real airplanes don't have an Autorudder feature
            (although some student pilots think of their flight
            instructor as the Autorudder). Therefore, if you decide
            to take flight training in an actual airplane, you'll
            learn all about the rudder and how to use those
            pedals.</p>

            <p>Of course, without rudder pedal hardware or a rudder
            joystick, you'll most likely operate the airplane using
            the Autorudder feature. It simply makes no sense to
            deactivate this feature of Flight Simulator and let the
            airplane wobble all over the sky.</p>

                  just have a joystick with the rudder function
                  built in. Try twisting it!) It won't be long
                  after you hook it up that you stop and ask
                  yourself, &quot;Hey, when do I use the rudder?&quot; One
                  answer is, any time you use the ailerons (such as
                  when you're making a turn).</p>

                  <p>Think of a rudder as a vertical aileron
                  located on the tail of the airplane. A right or
                  left deflection of the rudder foot pedals changes
                  the angle that the vertical stabilizer makes
                  relative to the wind, causing the airplane to yaw
                  about its vertical axis. This yawing motion keeps
                  the airplane's nose pointed in the direction of
                  the turn.</p>

                  <p>Applying the right rudder pedal, as shown by
                  Airplane A in Figure 2-6, forces the tail
                  assembly to swing in the direction of lower
                  pressure.</p>

                  </table>

                  <p>As the tail moves, the airplane rotates about
                  its vertical axis. Application of right rudder
                  pedal yaws the nose to the right. Applying left
                  rudder pedal, shown by Airplane B, yaws the nose
                  to the left (surprising, huh?).</p>

                  <p>If you don't use rudder in a turn, part of the
                  airplane will try to go in a direction different
                  from the direction of bank. This is not a pretty
                  sight, and your instructor's eyebrows will rise
                  so high that they will scratch his or her back.
                  An easy way to remember this is: right turn,
                  right rudder and left turn, left rudder. Feet and
                  hands move together.</p>

                  <p>Now the question foremost in your upper-brain
                  is &quot;How much rudder is enough?&quot; Good question.
                  Figure 2-7 shows an inclinometer, also known as
                  the ball, as a part of another instrument called
                  the turn coordinator.</p>

                  <p>The little white airplane in the turn
                  coordinator shows the direction of the turn,
                  while the ball tells you if the proper amount of
                  rudder is being applied. The ball is free to roll
                  right or left within the glass tube. Any
                  inappropriate rudder use (or lack of use) applies
                  an unnecessary side force to the airplane. This
                  deflects the ball in much the same way sunglasses
                  scoot across your car's dash when rounding a
                  sharp corner. Your job is to keep the ball
                  centered by using the rudder.</p>

                  <p>Airplane A's nose is pointed outside the turn
                  (probably because of insufficient right rudder or
                  too much right aileron being applied). The ball
                  and the airplane slip to the right, toward the
                  inside of the turn. In other words, you need to
                  point the nose slightly to the right for a
                  precisely aligned turn. By adding enough right
                  rudder to align the airplane in the direction
                  it's turning, the ball returns to the center, as
                  shown by Airplane B.</p>

                  <p>Airplane C's nose points toward the inside of
                  the turn (probably because too much right rudder
                  is applied or insufficient right aileron is
                  used.) The ball and the airplane skid to the
                  left, toward the outside of the turn. Adding a
                  little left rudder keeps the nose pointed in the
                  direction the airplane is turning and centers the
                  ball.</p>

                  <p>Simply stated, if the ball is deflected to the
                  right or left of center, add enough right or left
                  rudder (respectively) to center the ball.
                  Sometimes you'll hear your instructor say, &quot;Step
                  on the ball!&quot; This is simply your instructor's
                  way of telling you to add right rudder for a
                  right-deflected ball or left rudder for a
                  left-deflected ball. Don't even think about
                  placing your foot on the turn coordinator, or
                  your instructor will question you about your SAT
                  scores. Don't put marbles in your shoes
                  either.</p>

                  <p>When entering a turn, aileron and rudder are
                  applied simultaneously and in the same direction.
                  This is what pilots mean when they refer to
                  &quot;flying coordinated&quot;. Aileron establishes the
                  degree of bank, and rudder keeps the nose pointed
                  in the direction of turn. If the ball is centered
                  during this process, we say that the controls are
                  properly coordinated.</p>
