            <p>Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to stick you in an
            airplane that's capable of doing 120 knots&#8212;twice
            as fast as most cars on the freeway below&#8212;and I
            have only one request: I want you to fly as slow as you
            can. Sounds reasonable, right? Not really. This is like
            asking an Indy 500 racecar driver not to take his
            machine out of first gear. There is, however, a good
            reason for flying slowly.</p>

            <p>The practice of slow flight is the proving ground in
            which you prepare for aviation's biggest event:
            landing. After all, you don't want to land at cruise
            speeds, because airplanes weren't designed to maneuver
            on the surface at high velocities. You don't want to
            burn the tires off the rims, do you? (Just kidding, but
            it's not far from the truth.) In general, the slower
            you are upon touchdown, the easier it is to control the
            airplane on the runway.</p>

            <p>Additionally, airplanes can't fly too slowly, or
            they'll cease flying and start falling (this is called
            stalling, but it has nothing to do with the engine
            stopping, as you'll later learn). That's why I want you
            to feel comfortable operating at slower speeds so
            you'll know where the dangers are. And, as you'll
            eventually discover, it's sometimes necessary to follow
            slower airplanes. You need to know how to adjust your
            airspeed to prevent chewing up their tail feathers.
            These are only a few of the reasons we practice slow
            flight. It's an important maneuver. Let's get started
            by discussing how airplane wings develop lift.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Wing and Its Things</p>

            <p>In ground school many years ago, my instructor asked
            me about the origin and definition of the word &quot;wing.&quot;
            I replied, &quot;Ma'am, I think it means 'the arm of a
            bird'.&quot; She mumbled something about why many animals
            eat their young at birth and then went to the
            dictionary to look up the definition. Wing was defined
            as &quot;a moveable, paired appendage for flying.&quot; She
            looked at me and said, &quot;Well, what does that sound like
            to you?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, ma'am, that sounds like the arm
            of a bird to me.&quot; We agreed to disagree, even though I
            was right.</p>

            <p>The wing has several distinct parts: the upper
            cambered surface, lowered cambered surface, leading
            edge, trailing edge, and chord line (Figure 4-1).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson4Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 4-1 The Five
                Components of a Wing.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Notice that the upper cambered (meaning curved)
            surface seems to have a greater curve to it than the
            lower cambered surface. This isn't accidental. In fact,
            this is so important that we'll talk about it in detail
            shortly.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the only term whose definition isn't
            intuitively obvious is the chord line. The chord line
            is an imaginary line connecting the wing's leading edge
            with its trailing edge. Believe me, there is no line
            inside the wing that looks like this. It's only
            imaginary, just like the arrows showing the four forces
            in Lesson 1. When the shoe salesperson points to your
            foot and says, &quot;Your toe is here,&quot; you want to respond
            by saying, &quot;Thanks, I've been looking for that.&quot; In
            reality, he or she is pointing out the position of
            something not visually obvious. The chord line does
            something similar. Given the wing's curved surfaces,
            it's difficult to tell which way the wing points. Since
            engineers don't like uncertainty, they agreed that the
            chord line will represent the general shape of a
            wing.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">How the Wing Works</p>

            <p>To understand lift, you must visualize how the wing
            attacks the air. Aeronautical engineers talk about the
            wing contacting, or attacking, the air at a specific
            angle. This occurs in much the same way a pit bull
            attacks a mailman&#8212;mouth first. What part of the
            wing does the attacking? Is it the leading edge? Is it
            the trailing edge? Or is it the bottom of the wing?
            This is where the definition of chord line becomes
            useful.</p>

            <p>Because wings come in variable sizes and shapes
            (just like pilots), it is sometimes difficult to
            determine exactly how and where the wind strikes the
            wing. Fortunately, the chord line substitutes as a
            general reference for the shape of the wing. If I say
            that the wind blows onto the wing at an 18-degree
            angle, I'm saying that the angle between the wind and
            the chord line is 18 degrees (Figure 4-2).</p>

                The angle of attack is the<br>

                wind<br>
                (this is the wind that is blowing on the

            <p>This distinction, although seemingly trite, is as
            important to an engineer as tightly stitched pant seams
            are to a matador.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Relative Wind</p>

            <p>Only one more definition needs be absorbed before
            the secrets of lift are revealed. That term is called
            the relative wind (which is not a reference to an uncle
            who tells long stories without inhaling).</p>

            <p>Movement of an airplane generates wind over the
            wing. This wind is called the relative wind because it
            is relative to (or results from) motion. For instance,
            in Figure 4-3, no matter which way the jogger runs, he
            feels wind in his face that's relative (opposite and
            equal) to his motion.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

                jogger<br>
                feels wind on his face as a result of his running
                motion.<br>
                Relative wind is relative (opposite and equal) to

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Relative wind is movement-generated wind that's
            equal to and opposite to the motion of the airplane. To
            illustrate this point, stick your hand out the window
            of a moving automobile (keep all other body parts
            inside, please). You'll feel wind blowing opposite the
            motion of the car. Drive a car backwards on the
            freeway, and you will feel wind and hear a lot of horns
            blowing from directly behind you (you'll also attract
            the police).</p>

            <p>Move the airplane forward, as shown by Airplane A in
            Figure 4-4, and wind blows on its nose.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            </table>

            <p>As a airplane climbs or descends (that is, moves up
            or down the imaginary hill we discussed in Lesson 2),
            relative wind still blows on its nose (Airplanes B and
            C). But if an airplane drops straight down, without a
            change in pitch, the relative wind blows on its belly
            (Airplane D). As far as Airplane D is concerned, the
            wind is blowing on its belly despite the level
            attitude. As for the passengers, they're probably
            underneath the front seat in the fetal position making
            spiritual transmissions that don't require a radio. Try
            not to scare your passengers. It isn't nice, and they
            don't like it).</p>

            <p>The following point is so important, I want you to
            put one finger in your ear. Go ahead, do it before
            reading any further! I want you to do this because I
            don't want this information to go in one ear and out
            the other. The important principle to remember is that
            relative wind is independent of which way the
            airplane's nose is pointed. Relative wind is opposite
            in direction and equal to the airplane's velocity.
            Let's see how the wing actually attacks the wind to
            develop lift.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Attacking the Air</p>

            <p>Hunting is a sport to some people. It's also a sport
            where your opponent doesn't know it's a participant.
            Attacking an animal means that the hunter must point
            his weapon precisely at the prey. The hunter looks
            though the gun sight and sees the path of the bullet.
            An airplane is unlike a gun (and a car) in that its
            vertical climb path is different from its incline (the
            direction it points upward).</p>

            <p>Remember that 750-foot tower off the end of the
            runway? On takeoff, if you point your airplane slightly
            above the top of that obstacle (like a rifle sight),
            it's unlikely that you're going to clear it. In fact,
            the only thing being cleared is the area&#8212;as the
            firemen try to talk you down from the side of that
            tower. Remember, airplanes with limited thrust have
            shallower climb paths&#8212;unlike some fighter
            jets.</p>

            <p>The most important principle to understand here (put
            that finger back in the ear) is that the nose
            (therefore the wing) can be pointed on an incline
            that's different from the actual climb path. An angle
            exists between the amount the wing is inclined and its
            climb path (you'll soon see why). Remembering that the
            relative wind is always equal and opposite to the
            flight path, it's more precise to say that an angle
            exists between the chord line and the relative wind.
            This angle is known as the angle of attack (Figure
            4-5).</p>

            </table>

            <p>A more common way of saying this is that the wing's
            angle of attack is 5 degrees. Airplanes B, C, and D
            show increasing angles of attack of 10 degrees, 30
            degrees, and 45 degrees, respectively. The greater the
            difference between the wing and the relative wind, the
            greater the angle of attack. And, as you're about to
            see, the wing's lift is directly associated with its
            angle of attack.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">How Lift Develops</p>

            <p>The wing is the ultimate air slicer. As powerful as
            any Samurai sword or karate chop, it's a precision
            device for slicing air in a specific way. Wings are
            expressly built to plow through air molecules,
            separating them either above or below, while offering
            little resistance in the horizontal direction. Any
            horizontal resistance slows the wing down. This
            horizontal resistance is called drag, and it's
            definitely a case of less being better.</p>

            <p>Figure 4-7 shows how the airfoil (a fancy name for a
            wing) splits the wind when it's at a 10-degree angle of
            attack.</p>

            <p>Airflow strikes the leading edge of the wing forcing
            some air over (and some under) the airfoil. Both the
            air flowing over and the air flowing under the wing are
            responsible for generating lift. Let's first examine
            how the airflow striking the bottom of the wing
            produces some of the total lift that is developed.</p>

            <p>Sticking your hand out the window of a moving
            automobile does two things: it demonstrates how a
            relatively flat surface develops lift, and it signals a
            left turn. Figure 4-8 shows how wind is deflected
            downward when it strikes your hand.</p>

            <p>According to Sir Isaac Newton, who knew about such
            things, for every action there is an equal and opposite
            reaction. Wind deflected downward by the airfoil
            creates an upward (opposite) movement of the wing. This
            upward movement is caused by the impact energy of
            billions of tiny air molecules striking the underside
            of the wing. Also, higher pressure on the bottom
            surface of the wing results from this molecular impact.
            The wing moves upward as if it were being pushed from
            below.</p>

            <p>This type of lift is known as barn door lift, or
            impact lift. It generally contributes only a small
            portion of the total lift produced by the wings, which
            means that man and woman do not fly by barn-door lift
            alone. If we could, it would mean eccentric people
            would report flying barn doors instead of UFOs.</p>

            <p>A more subtle and powerful form of lift occurs from
            curved airflow over the top of the wing.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Bending the Wind with the Wing</p>

            <p>The Japanese invented the art of paper bending and
            called it origami. They then experimented with
            people-bending and called it judo. This art was not
            perfected, however, until the airlines adopted the
            practice, which is referred to as &quot;flying coach.&quot;</p>

            <p>Airliners (indeed all airplanes) bend something
            else&#8212;they use their wings to bend the wind. Wind
            bending did not sound sophisticated enough to explain
            why airplanes fly, so it was given a fancy Greek title.
            We call wind bending aerodynamics. Simply stated, the
            wing is a precision device for bending or curving the
            wind downward.</p>

            <p>But how does bending the wind over the wing create
            lift? Let's find out. Figure 4-9 shows a cross section
            of an airfoil.</p>

            <p>Examine its shape carefully. At small angles of
            attack, air flowing above the wing is bent, or curved,
            with great precision as it follows the upper cambered
            surface. A rather straight surface on the bottom of the
            wing leaves the air underneath relatively unbent.
            Bending, or curving, the wind above the wing forces air
            to travel a greater distance than the straighter
            airflow below. If the wind above is to reach the
            trailing edge at nearly the same time as the wind below
            (science and experiments say that it does), it must
            speed up to cover the greater distance.</p>

            <p>For example, assume you are walking your pit bull
            terrier (named Bob) on a leash. You are on the

            will travel on the sidewalk. In order for Bob to avoid
            being choked by the leash, he will have to speed up

            a wing? It's curved on top and rather straight on the

                  Bernoulli!</p>

                  <p>Something remarkable happens when air flowing
                  over a surface increases its speed. In the late
                  1600s, a Swiss physicist named Jacob Bernoulli
                  (pronounced ber-NEW-lee) figured out that the
                  faster air flows over a surface, the less
                  pressure it exerts on that surface. High-velocity
                  airflow over a wing causes a slight decrease in
                  pressure on the wing's upper surface. In other
                  words, the pressure on top of the wing is now
                  less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing
                  (Don't ask why. It has to do with translational
                  kinetic energy, and explaining that will give you
                  something that feels like a two-scoop lobotomy).
                  Known as Bernoulli's principle, this wonderful
                  trick is what keeps airplanes from being large
                  and expensive doorstops.</p>

            <p>Most wings are designed with their upper surface
            curved and their lower surface relatively straight.
            Because of the wing's shape, even at a small angle of
            attack, a cambered wing still adds a slight curve and
            acceleration to the wind. This produces the lift you
            learn to love, particularly if you think an airplane
            should fly.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Angle of Attack and the Generation
            of Lift</p>

            <p>During takeoff on a commercial airliner, have you
            ever noticed that the pilot always raises the nose
            slightly to begin the climb after attaining a minimum
            forward speed? This is called rotation, and it isn't
            something that's done to the airplane's tires.</p>

            <p>As the airplane accelerates for takeoff, it
            eventually reaches a sufficient speed to begin flying.
            At this relatively slow speed, however, the wing's
            engineered curve isn't capable of curving, or
            deflecting, enough air downward to produce the
            necessary lift for flight. This is why the airplane
            doesn't hop off the ground like a grasshopper that just
            landed on a hot barbecue. The pilot must do something
            extra to add an additional curve to the wind. Raising
            the nose slightly increases the angle of attack. This
            forces the air to undergo an additional curve greater
            than that which the engineered shape of the airfoil can
            produce. Figure 4-11 depicts this process.</p>

            <p>With this additional curvature, air travels a
            greater distance, its speed increases, pressure lowers
            on top of the airfoil, and sufficient lift to begin
            flying is produced at a slower airspeed (thanks for the
            lift, Bernoulli!). Greater impact lift results from
            increased exposure of the wing's lower surface to the
            relative wind. The result is that an increasing angle
            of attack permits the airplane to produce the necessary
            lift for flight at a slower airspeed.</p>

            <p>Now you know how airfoils generate the required lift
            at slower airspeeds. You also know why airplanes taking
            off or landing at slower speeds seem to have a rather
            nose-high attitude. But what happens at higher
            airspeeds? Have you noticed that in cruise flight at
            cruise airspeeds, airplanes fly at near-level flight
            attitudes?</p>

                angle of attack and airspeed is clearly shown.<br>
                With increasing airspeed, the airplane requires a
                smaller angle<br>
                of attack to remain airborne. As the airplane's
                airspeed<br>

            <p>At higher speeds, airplanes can fly at lower angles
            of attack because the wing's shape generates sufficient
            lift. Slow the airplane, and the wing must artificially
            bend the wind by increasing its angle of attack.</p>

            <p>An intimate and sizzling relationship exists between
            angle of attack and lift. If lift and angle of attack
            were Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, Atlanta wouldn't
            be the only thing on fire. At small angles of attack
            (such as during cruise flight), the engineered shape of
            the airfoil generates sufficient lift for flight as
            long the airspeed is high. The impact of air underneath
            the wing doesn't play as big a role in lift development
            at higher (cruise) speeds because less of the wing's
            underside is exposed to the wind.</p>

            <p>In summary, the slower an airplane moves, the
            greater the angle of attack needed for flight. There
            is, however, such a thing as too much of a good thing.
            Bend the air too much, and instead of flowing smoothly
            over the wing and creating lift, it bubbles and burbles
            and pretty much fails to be uplifting. We call this
            condition a stall, and this will be covered in a future
            class.</p>

            <p>Now it's time to talk about the details of entering
            and leaving slow flight as it's done in the air.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Slow Flight in Action</p>

            <p>In straight-and-level flight at cruise power, the
            airplane moves through the air at approximately 110
            knots. Our pitch attitude at this airspeed is
            approximately 4 degrees nose up, as seen on the
            attitude indicator. From this condition, let's discuss
            how you'll enter slow flight. Let's make this realistic
            by supposing that you're preparing to land and must
            slow the airplane to 75 knots to keep from
            weed-whacking the airplane ahead of you.</p>

            Speed</p>

            <p>So far, you've examined how to fly the airplane at
            several different speeds. At this stage of your
            training, you should be aware that the throttle is best
            used to maintain your altitude or rate of descent. The
            airspeed is maintained by adjusting the airplane's
            pitch attitude. But what about when you're not trying
            to maintain a specific speed, such as in cruise flight?
            After all, in cruise flight, you don't maintain your
            altitude using throttle adjustments, do you? No, you
            don't. Here's why.</p>

            <p>In cruise flight, you typically set the throttle to
            a power setting that won't harm the engine (for
            simplicity in teaching, we'll assume that the
            application of full throttle in any of our simulations
            won't hurt the engine). Then, for the most part, you
            leave the throttle alone. You're not necessarily
            concerned with maintaining a specific airspeed in
            cruise flight. In this case, power is fixed at a
            specific setting, and you make slight adjustments in
            pitch attitude to hold or modify your altitude. In slow
            flight, however, you'll use power to control your
            altitude and pitch (joystick) to control your airspeed.
            This might be the opposite of what you'd guess. As
            you'll soon see, however, this is the basic technique I
            want you to use when landing an airplane.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">You're on Your Own</p>

            <p>Now I want you to proceed to the interactive lesson
            and practice slow flight in the airplane. Your ultimate
            objective is to maintain altitude and heading while
            trying to fly at various slow flight-speeds. At first,
            you'll find it a bit tricky to maintain airspeed and
            altitude while flying a precise heading. So establish
            your priorities as follows: First, adjust pitch to give
            you the airspeed you want. Then, while maintaining that
            pitch attitude, make small adjustments in power to hold
            your altitude.</p>

            <p>If you feel lucky, try slow flight in turns. But be
            careful in those turns. Remember from Lesson 2 that a
            slight increase in pitch attitude was necessary to
            maintain altitude in a turn. Now that you know how to
            use the throttle, you'll want to add a little bit of
            power, if necessary, to help maintain altitude in a
            turn. The steeper the turn, the more power you'll need.
            Be generous with your use of trim in slow flight
            (although it's best not to trim in turns since turns
            are transient conditions). This prevents the airplane
            slinking away from the pitch attitude you want if your
            attention is diverted from the instrument panel. Above
            all, have fun!</p>
