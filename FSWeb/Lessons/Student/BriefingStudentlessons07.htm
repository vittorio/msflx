            <p>You will depart on runway 19 at Bremerton National
            airport. You instructor will communicate with you by
            hand-held radio during the flight. He will give you
            instructions on when to take off and climb to 1500
            feet. He'll instruct you when to turn to fly around the
            pattern. You'll fly an approach back to runway 19 and
            land. Your instructor will not be able to help you
            control the airplane in any way, but he will help you
            out with verbal instructions. Once lined up with the
            runway, he will let you complete the approach and
            landing without verbal assistance. If you land and come
            to a complete stop on the runway, your instructor will
            issue you a solo certificate.</p>
