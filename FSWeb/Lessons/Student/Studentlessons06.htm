            <p>There's a saying that every pilot knows, and since
            you're going to be a pilot, you should know it, too:
            Takeoffs are optional; landings are mandatory.</p>

            <p>Landings are to a pilot what a beautiful painting is
            to an artist. When you look at Leonardo da Vinci's
            &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (or its famed counterpart, the &quot;Mona
            Larry&quot;), you see a beautiful work of art. To pilots, a
            good landing offers the same satisfaction. I intend to
            show you how to paint that beautiful picture on any
            runway of your choice.</p>

            <p>We're going to approach this class a little
            differently than I would in the actual airplane. I plan
            on teaching you how to land before teaching you about
            flying the traffic pattern (which will be covered in
            the private pilot curriculum). That way, when I teach
            you to take off and fly a traffic pattern, you can
            actually land instead of dropping to earth with all the
            grace of a butterfly that's overdosed on caffeine.
            Besides, something tells me that if we don't do
            landings now, you'll be out there practicing them
            yourself. So let me help you put your hand in the
            cookie jar.</p>

            <p>I always tell my students that airplanes will land
            themselves (well, almost). All the pilot has to do is
            nudge the plane toward the runway and twiddle the
            throttle a bit. Let's examine how this is done by
            landing an airplane in your brain, or, to put it
            another way, by using your imagination to make your
            first landing.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Your First (Mental) Landing</p>

            <p>Before we get started, I'd like to note that we'll
            use a 65 knot approach speed for these ground school
            examples. Our actual flight lessons will use 75 knots.
            This increase in approach speed will make it easier for
            you to acquire landing skill in the simulator. Always
            refer to the appraoch speed reference data on the
            kneeboard for the aircraft you are flying.</p>

            <p>For this visualized example, I want you to imagine
            that you're lined up with a long runway. Visualize
            yourself at 500 feet above the ground while approaching
            at a speed of 65 knots. The power is set to idle.
            Mentally adjust the pitch to maintain 65 knots. This
            will require about a 10-degree nose-up pitch, as shown
            in Figure 6-1.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson6Figure01.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 6-1</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Of course, you should also imagine trimming the
            airplane to maintain 65 knots. Now for the best part of
            this example: Imagine flying 65 knots at this pitch
            attitude all the way to touchdown with the power set to
            idle. What do you think will happen?</p>

            <p>If you said that the airplane will land, you're
            correct. In fact, as long as you maintain an airspeed
            of 65 knots, the airplane will almost land itself. Of
            course, if there is any carbon on the runway, you'll
            covert it to diamonds, perhaps sending a few groundhogs
            six feet under in the process. Despite the impact, this
            is nearly what a landing is like. The only difference
            between what you imagined and what makes a good landing
            is something called the landing flare.</p>

            <p>The fact is that we don't fly airplanes into the
            ground. We flare them just before we land. No, a flare
            isn't a lighted stick you throw out the window to let
            others know you're landing; It's a maneuver that
            involves changing the descent path to shallow the
            airplane's approach to the runway (that is, to make the
            approach less steep). The flare is begun during the
            last 10-15 feet above the ground. We'll talk about this
            in a bit. For now, you should understand that the
            secret to making good landings is letting the airplane
            do most of the work. In other words, if the airplane is
            trimmed for the proper airspeed, there's little else to
            do other than keep the wings level and make small
            adjustments in power to vary the glide path. The
            airplane will almost land itself if you keep it aligned
            with the runway.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Landing Details</p>

            <p>Why did I choose 65 knots as the speed to fly the
            final approach? (Final approach is the portion of the
            landing pattern where the airplane is lined up with the
            runway.) Pilots typically use a final approach speed
            that is 30 percent above the airplane's stall speed. In
            our case, the airplane's no-flap stalling speed is 50
            knots (this is where the green arc begins on the
            airspeed indicator). Thus, our &quot;plus-30 percent&quot; speed
            is 65 knots. Fly a little faster than that, and the
            airplane will tend to float and resist touching down on
            the landing spot you want. (Approaching too fast is one
            of the biggest mistakes new pilots face while learning
            to land). Fly a little slower, however, and you'll
            place the airplane uncomfortably close to its stall
            speed. Controlling your airspeed is perhaps the most
            important quality for a successful landing.</p>

            <p>For our lessons' airplane, 65 knots keeps the nose
            gear just a little higher in relation to the main gear,
            as shown in Figure 6-2.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson6Figure02.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 6-2</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Remember, as the airplane slows down, the angle of
            attack must increase to maintain lift. Therefore, an
            approach speed of 65 knots requires a slightly larger
            angle of attack. Thus, the nose gear rises relative to
            the main gear. Keep in mind that the Cessna 172 is a
            tricycle-gear airplane. It's designed to land on the
            two main gear wheels first, after which the nose gear
            is gently lowered to the ground. Land on the nose gear
            first, and you could invoke the scariest phrase in a
            pilot's vocabulary: insurance deductible. You could
            also &quot;porpoise,&quot; which is a bouncing action, not a
            tuna's playmate.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Playing with Power</p>

            <p>Let's say you've trimmed the airplane for a
            power-off descent at 65 knots. As you approach the
            runway, you discover that your approach path will take
            you to a point short of the runway. This isn't a good
            thing. After all, airplanes are supposed to land on
            runways, not in the farmer's field short of the runway.
            How can you tell if you're going to land short in the
            first place and what you should do to correct this
            problem?</p>

            <p>You can tell that you're descending too quickly when
            you observe the runway geometry changing, as shown in
            Figure 6-3.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            <p>Figure 6-3A is what the runway should look like over
            the panel when you're on an acceptable glide path.
            Figure 6-3B is what the runway looks like when you're
            too low (below the desired glide path). Figure 6-3C is
            what you'll see when you're too high (above the desired
            glide path).</p>

            <p>Notice that the distance between the far end of the
            runway and the distant horizon decreases in Figure
            6-3B. Also notice that both ends of the runway appear
            to converge. Both of these are good visual cues that
            you're below a desired glide path. Finally, you know
            you're too low when desert shrubbery appears at eye
            level and you skid your tires on a desert tortoise.</p>

            <p>Without using any mechanical or electronic aids, it
            does takes some practice and experience to tell when
            you're on the correct glide path to the runway. At some
            airports, there are devices that can help you determine
            the proper glide path for a particular runway. Take a
            look at the sidebar on VASIs to learn more about these.
            When you first begin the interactive lesson on
            landings, it's okay to rely on your gut feeling about
            whether or not you're high or low on approach; this
            will train your visceral senses. If you hear the wheels
            squeak before reaching the runway, you know you're too
            low. If you see the runway disappear underneath the
            airplane, you know you're too high. It doesn't get any
            more basic than that. After you gain just a little
            experience, you'll get better and better at selecting
            the proper glide path. Trust me, after all, I'm your
            flight instructor.</p>

                  Indicator (VASI)</p>

                  <p>Under poor visibility conditions or at night,
                  the lack of outside visual clues sometimes makes
                  determination of the proper landing glidepath
                  difficult. Fortunately, there is something known
                  as a Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) that
                  provides you with a visual clue as to the proper
                  glidepath to fly. (By the way, VASI is pronounced
                  VAZ-eee. It is not something in which you put
                  flowers).</p>

                  <p>A VASI usually consists of two pairs of
                  lightbars along the side of the runway (it's
                  often called a two-bar VASI for this reason). The
                  two VASI bars are usually 500 to 1,000 feet from
                  the approach threshold, as shown in Figure 6-13.
                  These lights project either a red or white color,
                  depending on your altitude. The colors are
                  constant and don't actually change within the
                  box. What it does change is your height, which
                  allows you to look at the VASI from different
                  angles and see different colors.</p>

                  <p>When you are below the proper glideslope, both
                  VASI bars show red. Some pilots remember that
                  this signals trouble by thinking of it as, &quot;Red
                  over red, you'll conk your head.&quot; You should
                  level off until you see red over white. Red over
                  white means that you're above the glidepath for
                  the bar closest to you and below the glidepath
                  for the bar farthest away. This is a complicated
                  way of saying you're on the glidepath that will
                  plunk you down halfway between the two bars. A
                  good way to remember this is, &quot;Red over white,
                  you're all right.&quot;</p>

                  <p>Of course, if you're too high, both bars will
                  show white. A good memory aid for this is, &quot;White
                  over white, you'll soon be out of sight.&quot;
                  Increase the descent rate until the upwind bar
                  turns red. You can expect the VASI's red and
                  white bars to transition through a pink color as
                  your altitude in relation to the proper
                  glideslope changes.</p>

                  <p>If you see flashing red over flashing white,
                  then you're making an approach to a police car.
                  Now you're in really big trouble (besides, it's
                  not natural for the VASI bars to chase cars down
                  the highway).</p>

                  <p>When we practice landings in this lesson,
                  you'll notice another type of visual glide slope
                  indicator at Bremerton National Airport. Figure
                  6-14 shows a PAPI (Precision Approach Path
                  Indicator). It uses red and white signaling
                  colors in an arrangement of four horizontal
                  lights to identify the correct glidepath. These
                  four horizontal light units appear to change
                  color as your glidepath varies. If you're above a
                  3.5 degree glide slope, the PAPI shows all four
                  light units as white. When on a 3 degree glide
                  slope, the right two lights are red and the left
                  two lights are white. When below a 2.5 degree
                  glide slope, all four light units show red. A
                  pink transition between lights does not exist as
                  it does with a two- or three-bar VASI.</p>

            <p>Okay, let's suppose you know you're too low. How do
            you correct for this?</p>

            <p>At the first indication of being too low, increase
            power. This is a no-brainer (although I want you to
            keep your brain because you're going to need it for the
            flare). You'll notice that your descent rate
            immediately decreased a little after adding power, as
            shown in Figure 6-4.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            </table>

            <p>Small power adjustments make small adjustments in
            glide path. Use whatever power you need to get the
            airplane to the runway, all the while maintaining an
            approach speed of 65 knots. Ideally, your glide path
            should take you straight to the runway without numerous
            vertical bends or curves in the airplane's trajectory.
            Ah, if this were only a perfect world, eh? It's not.
            Therefore, be willing to make any power adjustments to
            vary the glide path as necessary to make it to the
            runway.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, if you're way too low, it's
            perfectly reasonable to add power and hold your
            altitude until you're in a position for a normal glide
            to the runway. Once again, experience will tell you
            when you're in a position to reduce power and begin a
            normal glide to the runway. Of course, if you've
            misjudged and are really low, you should start a climb.
            Then, when you're high enough for a normal glide to the
            runway, you reduce power and commence the descent. It
            may look like a spaghetti approach, but it's your
            approach (however, you should be prepared for an &quot;al
            dente&quot; landing). Do whatever it takes to get to that
            runway. Make sure you use your trim during this
            process, too.</p>

            <p>What do you do if you're too high? We'll cover that
            shortly. For now, let's look at how to flare the
            airplane for landing.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Landing Flare</p>

            <p>Until now, you've mentally flown the airplane onto
            the runway at a final approach speed of 65 knots. You
            might be able to get away with this in a real airplane,
            but only in an emergency. At 65 knots, the simulated
            airplane is in a minimally acceptable landing attitude
            (that is, the airplane is pitched nose-up, putting the
            nose gear slightly above the main gear. This is a good
            thing). Additionally, the descent rate in this
            simulation isn't so excessive that the landing will
            bruise everyone's bones, although it's still possible
            to sustain some damage to a real airplane during
            landing. Therefore, to land properly under all
            conditions, you must learn to flare the airplane to
            ensure a soft, safe touchdown.</p>

            <p>You should begin the landing flare at approximately
            10 to 15 feet above the runway, as shown in Figure
            6-5.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson6Figure05.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>While descending at the desired approach speed,
            start the flare by raising the nose with a slight and
            gentle pull on the joystick. How much of a pull? Once
            again, that's a matter of experience. The objective is
            to lower your descent angle and decrease the airspeed
            for landing. Now the airplane can settle onto the
            runway at a smaller descent rate and at a slightly
            higher nose-up attitude. This makes for a softer
            touchdown and keeps the nose gear higher than the main
            gear, as shown in Figure 6-6.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson6Figure06.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 6-6</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If your speed is too high on the approach (that is,
            faster than 30 percent above the airplane's stall
            speed), it's likely that you'll float or possibly begin
            to climb during the flare. This is not a good time for
            this to happen. Floating means the airplane just won't
            land. Unless you have a long runway, this may mean that
            you'll turn an expensive airplane into an off-road
            vehicle as you bust through the fence surrounding the
            airport. If you pull back too quickly during the flare,
            you may find yourself 50 to 100 feet above the runway
            while out of airspeed and ideas at the same time. In
            this instance, you'll need to add power, lower the nose
            a bit, and descend to a point where you can flare
            again. If you don't do this, the airplane might stall.
            Excuse me for saying this, but practicing stalls at 100
            feet above the ground is definitely a ground-breaking
            idea. (Ouch! Deductible!) The only time it's legitimate
            for the airplane to stall during the flare is when it
            does so a few inches above the ground. This way, it
            only has inches to fall, which hurts neither the
            airplane nor those on board. Yes, the flare requires a
            little timing, but there's a lot of latitude in how
            it's accomplished.</p>

            <p>How can you tell when you're at a flare height of 10
            to 15 feet? In a real airplane, you have peripheral
            vision to help. In the normal cockpit view of the
            simulator, you can't use any cues from the side windows
            because you don't have side windows. (You could try the
            Virtual Cockpit view, which allows you to pan around in
            any direction using the hat switch on top of your
            joystick. Try it! On the View menu, select View
            Options, and then choose Virtual Cockpit.)</p>

            <p>With practice, even in the normal cockpit view,
            you'll develop your ability to determine your height
            above the runway. In the meantime, you can use the
            altitude of the runway (or airport elevation) as an
            aid. Suppose, for instance, that the airport's
            elevation is 2,787 feet above sea level. You can begin
            your flare when the altimeter reads 2,800 feet. Of
            course, this is only a helpful hint when learning to
            land in a simulator. You shouldn't be doing this when
            you become a pilot and are landing a real airplane. It
            will make your copilot nervous.</p>

            <p>There is one more nifty idea that can help you land
            smoothly if you're having a hard time identifying when
            to flare. When you even think you're getting close to
            flare height, add just enough power to slow the descent
            rate to 100 feet per minute while maintaining your
            approach speed, as shown in Figure 6-7.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This is close to how seaplane pilots make approaches
            to glassy lakes that have no ripples on them. It's
            difficult to judge your height above a lake that
            reflects like a mirror. Maintaining a
            100-foot-per-minute descent rate at the approach speed
            will allow the airplane to make an acceptable touchdown
            (and avoid conking a trout on its head). Doing this on
            a runway means that your landing distance will be
            longer because of the addition of power, so be sure to
            have a long enough runway.</p>

            <p>Under normal conditions, you should gradually reduce
            power to idle when you begin the flare. Then, you
            should gently raise the nose to flare attitude and
            allow the airplane to settle onto the runway at this
            attitude. If you need a better idea of how high to
            raise the nose, trying raising it to a 14-degree pitch
            attitude on the attitude indicator. At this attitude,
            the airplane will settle onto the runway. As the
            airplane continues to slow down, you'll need to
            increase back pressure on the joystick to maintain the
            desired nose-up flare attitude. Once you've touched
            down, gently release any joystick pressure to lower the
            nose gear onto the runway (in airplanes, the nose gear
            provides directional control after landing).</p>

            <p>It's also not unusual to lose sight of the runway
            over the panel as you begin the flare. In a real
            airplane, you could jack the seat up to get a better
            view. (No, the instructor isn't going to put you on his
            or her lap to give you a better view.) In the
            simulator, you have neither a jack nor an instructor to
            give you a boost. Raise the simulator's seat by pushing
            SHIFT+ENTER. Don't worry, this isn't an ejection seat.
            Raise the seat as high as you need to get the best
            view. To lower the seat, press SHIFT+BACKSPACE.</p>

            <p>Wonderful! You have a flair for the flare. Of
            course, there's something of an art to perfecting this,
            but you'll eventually master it with practice. Now that
            you understand the flare, let's discuss how to do it
            with full flaps. When do we use flaps? When the
            airplane is too high and we need to increase our rate
            and angle of descent. Let's discuss flaps in detail
            before we discuss how to land an airplane using
            them.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Flap over Flaps</p>

            <p>Ever wondered why the wings of large commercial
            airplanes sprout aluminum prior to takeoff and landing?
            Fast airplanes require small, thin wings to achieve the
            eye-popping velocity needed to satisfy today's
            speed-hungry air traveler. The problem with thin, small
            wings is that they stall at high speeds. Most jet
            airliners would have to take off and land at close to
            200 mph to achieve a safe margin above stall if they
            couldn't enlarge and curve their wing's surface area
            enough to create a temporary, low-speed wing.
            Engineers, however, design wings to do just that by
            supplying them with flaps. Extending or retracting
            flaps changes the wing's lift and drag
            characteristics.</p>

            <p>Lowering flaps lowers the trailing edge of the wing,
            as shown in Figure 6-8.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

                More.<br></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The wing's lift is increased in two ways. First, the
            lowered trailing edge increases the angle the chord
            line makes with the relative wind. Greater lift results
            from this increased angle of attack. Second, the
            lowered trailing edge increases the curvature on part
            of the wing, resulting in increased air velocity over
            the wing's upper surface (many flaps even increase the
            wing's surface area by extending downward and outward,
            as the Cessna 172 do). Because of the larger angle of
            attack and greater curvature, flaps provide you with
            more lift for a given airspeed.</p>

            <p>What's the reason for putting flaps on small
            airplanes? First and foremost, they create the lift
            necessary to maintain flight at slower airspeeds. When
            landing, your goal is to approach and touch down at a
            reasonably slow speed. You certainly don't want to
            touch down at cruise speed. Such a high-speed landing
            might just turn your tires into three little puffs of
            smoke. Flaps allow you to approach and land at a slower
            speed while maintaining a safe margin above the stall
            speed.</p>

            <p>A slower speed on touchdown means less runway is
            used to stop. This is an important consideration if the
            runway is short. Alternatively, if the wind is gusty,
            you might consider approaching with little or no flap
            extension. At the slower speeds allowed by flaps, the
            airplane becomes more difficult to control because the
            controls are not as responsive. Let's see how
            effectively the flaps increase lift by referring to the
            airspeed indicator (as shown in Figure 6-9).</p>

            <p>The beginning of the white arc (B) is known as the
            power-off, full-flap stalling speed (in nonaccelerated
            flight at the airplane's maximum allowable weight).
            It's the speed at which the airplane stalls with flaps
            fully extended, power off, and the gear extended. In
            Figure 6-9, the airplane will fly when 53 knots of wind
            blows over the wings if they are below their critical
            angle of attack.</p>

            <p>The high-speed end of the white arc is the maximum
            speed you can fly with flaps fully extended. Flying
            beyond this speed can damage the flaps. In this
            example, you wouldn't want the airspeed indicator to
            indicate more than 107 knots with flaps extended (some
            airplanes, however, allow you to fly at a higher speed
            with partial flaps extended). Bringing broken or bent
            airplanes back from a flight isn't a good idea, even if
            they are rentals (you'll find out how bad an idea it is
            when you get the bill for unbending the metal).</p>

            <p>Notice that the white arc (B) begins at a speed
            seven knots slower than the green arc (A). In an
            earlier discussion, we learned that the green arc is
            the power-off stalling speed with flaps retracted (gear
            retracted, too). This airplane must have 60 knots or
            more of wind flowing over the wings to fly with flaps
            retracted. With flaps fully extended, you can touch
            down at a slower speed&#8212;seven knots slower, to be
            exact (the full-flap stall speed on the airspeed
            indicator assumes the airplane is flying at its maximum
            allowable weight).</p>

            <p>But, as might say, &quot;Those who sow 'wild oats'
            eventually have crop failure.&quot; In other words, you
            don't get something for nothing. Flaps provide you with
            lift, but they also produce drag. Full flaps create a
            low-speed wing. Try to accelerate it, and at some
            point, drag defeats your efforts. Fortunately, the
            first half of flap travel usually provides more lift
            than drag. The last half usually provides more drag
            than lift. This is why some aircraft manuals recommend
            only 10 to 25 degrees of flaps for takeoffs on short
            fields (usually one or two notches on a three- to
            four-notch, manual flap system).</p>

            <p>If you're too high while on approach to land, you
            can select full flaps to increase the airplane's drag.
            It's common to use flaps only when descending within
            the traffic pattern and not when descending from cruise
            flight. After all, cruise flight descents are efficient
            and fast at higher speeds, where the drag is greater.
            If you wanted to descend with flaps from cruise flight,
            you'd have to slow the airplane down below maximum
            flap-extension speed (the top of the white arc) before
            applying flaps. This would be cumbersome. The airplane
            can descend faster at cruise speed with reduced power
            while getting you to your destination sooner.</p>

            <p>Since flaps provide more lift at slower speeds,
            think carefully about how and when they are retracted
            while airborne. If you're making a full-flap approach
            and it's necessary to go around (that is, give up this
            approach, climb, and return for another landing
            attempt), don't retract the flaps all at once! This
            would be like having someone remove a part of your wing
            at a slow speed. The sudden and often dramatic increase
            in stall speed could place you near a stall before you
            can accelerate to a safer speed. Apply full power
            first, and then retract the flaps in increments. In
            airplanes with 30 to 40 degrees of flap extension,
            retract the flaps to their least-drag/maximum-lift
            position. Usually, this position is found at one-half
            flap travel (depending on the airplane). In airplanes
            with three notches of manually applied flaps, retract
            one notch first, followed by the other two, once the
            airplane begins to accelerate.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Landing using Flaps</p>

            <p>You can apply flaps using the flap handle (Figure
            6-10) or by pressing the F7 key. (You can retract them
            by pressing F6.)</p>

            <p>Since flaps alter the lift and drag characteristics
            of the wing, be ready to adjust the pitch to maintain
            the airspeed you want. Applying full flaps creates a
            lot of drag. Flap application also causes the airplane
            to pitch up, requiring forward pressure on the joystick
            to maintain your airspeed. Here's how the process might
            go if you're too high and need to add flaps to
            compensate.</p>

            <p>Since the full-flap stalling speed for this airplane
            is 40 knots (that's where the white arc begins on the
            airspeed indicator), you'll want to approach at a
            slightly higher speed. Remember, pilots use an approach
            speed that's 30 percent above the stall speed for the
            airplane's present configuration. For this simulation,
            let's use 60 knots.</p>

            <p>While approaching without flaps at 65 knots, let's
            assume we notice the runway is disappearing below the
            top of the airplane's panel (Figure 6-11).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This is one cue that you're going to be too high on
            the approach. Now's the time to add flaps (or more
            flaps). You'll press F7 once to lower 10 degrees of
            flaps. You'll also have to apply a little forward
            pressure to correct for a flap-induced pitch up, and
            then readjust the pitch for a final approach speed of
            53 knots. Don't forget to trim!</p>

            <p>You'll apply the other 20 degrees of flaps in
            10-degree increments by pressing F7 two more times
            until 30 degrees of flaps are extended (that's full
            flaps for this airplane). As you press F7, make sure
            you adjust the pitch for 60 knots of airspeed.</p>

            <p>If flap usage is sufficient, you'll notice that the
            runway stops disappearing underneath the airplane. The
            airplane has also pitched forward a bit, allowing a
            better runway view. The descent rate will also be
            increased, and the airplane will fly at slightly less
            of a nose-up pitch as a result of flap application
            (that is, with flap application, the nose gear isn't as
            far above the main gear&#8212;an additional reason for
            the flare). as shown in Figure 6-12.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson6Figure12.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 6-12</span></td>

            <p>One of the first things you're sure to notice while
            using flaps is that the rate of descent is higher.
            That's why the flare needs to happen a little faster
            when using flaps. When you're at flare height, raise
            the nose from its present attitude to about 14 degrees
            nose-up pitch. Hold that attitude until touchdown. Yes,
            you may hear the stall horn (more on this in the stall
            section) as you touch down, but that's okay since
            you're just inches above the ground.</p>

            <p>So why use flaps? They allow you to touch down at
            slower speeds, which means the airplane needs to
            dissipate less energy when stopping. Additionally,
            flaps come in handy when you're too high on approach.
            They are also useful when landing over an obstacle or
            when landing on a short runway.</p>
