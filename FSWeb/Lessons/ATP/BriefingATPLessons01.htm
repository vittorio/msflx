            turns, descend, and fly a visual approach to a full
            stop landing back on runway 16L at KSEA.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>F7</strong> to operate the flaps<br>
            <strong>G</strong> to operate the landing gear<br>
