            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>You should complete all Student, Private,
            Commercial, and Instrument lessons before beginning
            this lesson. Reading the Ground School material before
            starting this lesson will help you better understand
            the skills being taught and terminology used in the
            lesson.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>In this lesson you will become familiar with flying
            the Boeing 737 from a cruise altitude to a specific
            altitude and location. You will start in-flight at
            FL280 and fly outbound from the Spokane VOR on the 255
            radial starting at about 90 DME at 300 KIAS. At the
            WITRO intersection, you will slow the airplane to 250
            knots. At the SWAUK intersection, you will begin a
            descent to cross the PAE VOR at 8000 feet within +500
            feet. During the descent, you will be taught how to
            anticipate the required descent rates and how to
            monitor progress during the descent. If you want to
            complete the approach into KSEA, you will be allowed
            to, but you will not be required to fly the approach in
            order to complete the lesson; you will receive minimal
            assistance from your instructor in this portion of the
            flight. (This is a good opportunity to practice your
            landing skills.)</p>

            <p>You can either hand-fly the lesson or use the
            autopilot for the entire lesson. This lesson does not
            teach using the autopilot, so you must bring those
            skills to the lesson if you choose to use the
            autopilot.</p>
