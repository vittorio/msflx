            <p>The challenges in moving up to the Boeing 737
            include the need for different procedures and
            management of complex systems; it's not the Cessna
            Skyhawk.</p>

            <p>To get checked out in the Boeing 737, you'll need to
            learn some key items, settings, and procedures.
            Successfully planning your flight is the key to flying
            the jet. In this lesson, you'll take off, fly a simple
            flight with a few turns, and set up for a controlled
            descent and landing. You'll never be the same after
            that first landing. No, I don't mean you'll be hunched
            over and in need of a chiropractor, either. I mean
            you'll have such a big smile on your face that your
            neighbors will think you are trying to show off a new
            set of teeth.</p>

                  <p>The 737&#8211;800 has a maximum weight at
                  takeoff of 174,200 pounds (79,010 kilograms),
                  measures 129 feet six inches long with a wingspan
                  of 112 feet seven inches, and has a maximum
                  height of 41 feet two inches (before our first
                  attempt at landing it). The airplane cruises at
                  0.785 Mach (530 miles per hour), over a maximum
                  range of 3,383 statute miles, at a maximum
                  altitude of 41,000 feet, all while carrying 162
                  to 189 passengers. As every airline chooses their
                  own configurations for seating, the number of
                  available seats will vary from airline to
                  airline, and from airplane to airplane.</p>

            <p>To gain better understanding for flying the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 in Flight Simulator, we will examine a
            variety of information regarding the airplane and its
            various flight configurations. This information
            includes airspeed settings, various flight profiles,
            and key flight instruments. We will organize the
            information following the common phases of flight. If
            you want a super-simplified approach to piloting the
            Boeing 737&#8211;800, see <a href=
            "ATPLessons01TableQuickStart.htm">Quick
            Start.</a></p><a name="Flight Profiles"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Flight Profiles</p>

            <p>Flight profiles refer to the configuration of the
            aircraft with respect to airspeed, power, pitch, flap
            position, and gear. It has nothing to do with how you
            look from the outside of the jet when flying and facing
            straight ahead. Each different phase of
            flight--takeoff, cruise, descent, approach, and
            landing--requires you to follow a specific profile. The
            key to a successful flight requires managing these
            settings. We will go into more detail on each of the
            different phases of flight and the specific settings
            used for the corresponding flight profile.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">What is a Flight Profile?</p>

            <p>Flight profiles are preset configurations used for
            the different phases of flight. Preset here means that
            an airline or aircraft manufacturer has established
            appropriate parameters that assure safe and controlled
            flight for a given phase. Typical phases of flight
            include takeoff, departure, level cruise, descent,
            initial approach, and the host of instrument approaches
            that the aircraft is certified to fly, such as ILS,
            VOR, NDB, GPS, CAT III, and so on.</p>

            <p>Profiles tell the pilot how to configure and fly the
            airplane at each point of the flight and provide
            guidance during the transitions. Actual speeds and
            weights are not typically included on a profile where
            standard operational procedures dictate that the pilot
            look up these values in performance charts. Where
            speeds are &quot;particular,&quot; they are listed on the
            profile. For the enjoyment of your lesson (and to keep
            your brain from exploding), we have included the
            minimum details necessary to facilitate your knowledge
            and understanding. Here are links to quick reference
            charts for different profiles discussed in this
            article:</p>

            <p>Take time to review (and perhaps print) each of
            these profiles, and then have fun putting the
            information to use. Feel free to pause the simulator to
            your heart's content while you get used to interpreting
            the information, otherwise the overload of information
            may cause your heart to pause. Remember, these profiles
            have been put together to help simplify understanding
            and facilitate an enjoyable session flying the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 in Flight Simulator. These profiles do
            not represent all issues, performance parameters, or
            any specific airline or manufacturer's published
            procedures. So have fun, and think of all that goes on
            the next time you fly a commercial airliner.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Understanding Takeoff Weight</p>

            <p>One of the key pieces of data for flying the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 is its weight. The weight of the aircraft
            is used during several phases of flight to determine
            items, such as takeoff and landing airspeeds as well as
            flap extension or retraction speeds. As you blaze
            around the airways, you burn fuel. The more fuel you
            burn, the lighter the jet becomes. The key fact here is
            that your weight will decrease from the start of your
            flight through to the end.</p>

            <p>The key weights you must know are the <em>takeoff
            weight</em> and <em>landing weight</em>. Each of these
            weights, combined with the outside temperature and
            density altitude, will be used to determine the proper
            airspeeds for takeoff and landing. Sounds complex? It
            can be, but we will make things very simple by using a
            few assumptions along with the Flight Simulator default
            settings for the Boeing 737&#8211;800.</p>

            <p>You might notice that the maximum taxi weight is
            higher than the maximum takeoff weight. This is to
            allow for the extra fuel you will burn taxiing around
            the airport and waiting in line for takeoff behind all
            those other aircraft that got there before you did.</p>

            <p>Also, notice that the maximum landing weight is less
            than the maximum takeoff weight. This means that you
            cannot just decide to land immediately after takeoff;
            the airplane might be too heavy, so planning a longer
            loop back for landing may be required.</p>

            <p>Zero fuel weight is the weight of the aircraft, all
            the baggage, and all the passengers but without
            <em>any</em> fuel on board. The zero fuel weight is
            important to know so that you can determine the actual
            weight of your aircraft at any time. Just add the
            current weight of your fuel to your zero fuel weight
            and your have your current weight.</p>

            <p>The one variable you have easy access to in Flight
            Simulator is your fuel load. The Boeing 737&#8211;800
            has three fuel tanks: left main, right main, and center
            tanks.</p>

            <p>Commercial aircraft utilize different flap settings

            temperature, density altitude, and surface conditions.
            An involved process determines the optimum flap setting
            for any given takeoff (this may be one reason that
            airlines hire an extra pilot or two to help do some of
            the math). However, to simplify things, we will
            standardize on using a flap setting of five (5) for

            <p>Speed management in the Boeing 737 is essential. The
            process used to determine the precise speeds during
            takeoff and landing can be complex and involve lookup
            tables (but not looking under them), aircraft
            configurations, weights, temperatures, and density
            altitudes&#8212;just to list a few. For our lesson, we
            will keep things simple by assuming outside conditions
            follow the &quot;Standard Day&quot; curve.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">V Speeds</p>

            <p>For takeoff, we will be most concerned with three
            key airspeeds: V1, Vr, and V2. These three speeds form
            the collection called &quot;V speeds.&quot; The key to selecting
            the correct V speed relies on aircraft weight, outside
            conditions, and the flap setting used for takeoff.
            Assuming the default Flight Simulator weight for the
            Boeing 737&#8211;800, &quot;standard&quot; conditions, and
            limiting flaps to a setting of 5, we can simplify
            choices to one set of values.</p>

            <p>V1 is the <em>takeoff decision speed</em>. Based upon
            aircraft takeoff weight, temperature, and density
            altitude, you will need a certain size runway for safe
            takeoff. There is a point after you have set full
            takeoff power where you must decide to abort the
            takeoff or continue to fly. In the Boeing 737, this
            point is determined using airspeed and is designated as
            V1. On the takeoff roll prior to reaching V1 you should
            have the ability to cut the power, apply maximum
            braking, and come to a safe stop before reaching the
            end of the runway, thereby preventing your jet from
            becoming an impressive but awkward looking dirt bike.
            After accelerating past V1, you are committed to
            becoming airborne. Based on the assumptions made above,
            we will use 150 knots indicated as our V1 speed in this
            lesson.</p>

            <p>Vr is the <em>rotation speed</em>. This is the speed
            at which you ease back on the elevator, raise the nose
            to the appropriate pitch (+20 degrees), and lift-off.
            We will use 154 knots indicated airspeed as the Vr
            speed. One thing to consider about the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 is that you can accidentally strike the
            tail on takeoff if you pitch up too aggressively at
            rotation, leaving you to make up a tall tale about the
            newly shortened tail. To prevent a tail strike, rotate
            to 20 degrees nose up at a rate no faster than 3
            degrees per second.</p>

            <p>V2 is the <em>minimum safe speed</em>. Should an
            engine fail immediately after V1, you will have enough
            power to complete the takeoff with the necessary climb
            rate and terrain clearance. Because takeoff can be
            accomplished using a variety of flap settings, an
            airspeed of V2+15 knots is used as the two-engine climb
            speed to assure minimum maneuvering speed for all
            takeoff flap settings.</p>

            <p>If you listened to a flight crew during the takeoff
            roll, you would hear the nonflying pilot call out the

            <p>Power in a turbine jet aircraft is not measured in
            flat rpm (revolutions per minute) as with a piston
            powered aircraft. Power in a turbine engine is measured
            in percent of maximum rpm, where maximum rpm is the
            certified or rated power output of the engine. There
            are two points of measure important to the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 pilot: the rpm of the low pressure
            turbine shaft&#8212;called N1, and the rpm of the high
            pressure turbine shaft&#8212;called N2.</p>

            <p>N1 is the percent of maximum rpm of the low pressure
            turbine shaft of the engine. N1 is the value that best
            correlates to the power output of the engine. This is
            the value you set by moving the throttles to adjust
            your target airspeeds.</p>

            <p>N2 is the percent of maximum rpm of the high
            pressure turbine shaft of the engine. This measures the
            speed of the tips of the turbine compressor blades. At
            any point of power production, the speed of the high
            pressure compressor fans should never exceed their
            designed maximum rpm limitations. Monitoring N2 enables
            us to guard against this.</p>

            <p>In this lesson we focus on N1, and we use N1 percent
            to set power.</p><a name="How to Take Off"></a>

            <p>Regardless of how you arrived on the runway, it is
            always a good idea to have everything tuned, twisted,
            and configured, and to have in mind what you plan to do
            upon takeoff. Typical airline flights have aircrews
            that have been given a departure procedure as part of
            their IFR clearance. In Flight Simulator, it's just
            easier for you to add power and begin rolling down the
            runway. There are always some basic procedures to
            follow during a straight out departure, such as
            limiting airspeed to 200 knots below 3,000 feet and 250
            knots between 3,000 and 10,000 feet.</p>

            <p>You might also want to review (and perhaps print)
            the approach and landing quick reference tables:

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Airspeed Limitations</p>

            <p>To follow actual airspace rules, a few speed
            limitations are important. In fact, you'll eventually
            be tested on a few of them in your ATP checkride. If
            you are departing a Class B airport, your airspeed must
            remain at 250 knots or below under 10,000 feet. For
            Class C or Class D airports, you must limit your speed
            to 200 knots within the airspace (usually 2,500 feet
            within 4 miles of the airport) and then limit to 250
            knots until reaching 10,000 feet. These limitations
            should be helpful in understanding the need for all the
            &quot;scripted&quot; procedures required during takeoff. For more
            information about airspace definitions, see the
            <strong>Glossary</strong> and the articles on <strong>Air Traffic
            Control</strong>.</p><a name="Cleared for Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Cleared for Takeoff</p>

            <p>Once you have the airplane all set up and
            configured, and you've received your takeoff clearance,
            increase the throttles to a power setting of 40 percent
            to 50 percent with the brakes set. This is often called
            &quot;standing up the throttles&quot; and serves two purposes.
            First, this allows you to scan the engine instruments
            to make sure everything is functioning and &quot;in the
            green.&quot; (Well, almost everything &#8230; you don't want
            your copilot to be green!) Second, this pause enables
            the engines to spool up to an intermediate level
            without overheating or overstressing the brakes while
            you scan the gauges. With both engines producing equal
            power and everything clear and in the green, release
            the brakes and set takeoff power to 95 percent of N1.
            You'll notice that the throttles are much more
            sensitive than in the Cessna Skyhawk SP or Beechcraft
            Baron 58. Rather than advancing the throttle all the
            way to full, try advancing them to about three quarters
            of the way to their full travel and slowly increase
            them to reach 95 percent of N1. Or, advance the
            throttles to full, and then back off some so not to
            exceed 95 percent.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Vr&#8212;Rotate</p>

            <p>Your next task is to monitor the speeds as we
            accelerate down the runway on centerline. Our first
            speed to review is V1, the go/no go decision point. Ask
            yourself if all systems are okay. If so, then continue.
            Vr, our rotation speed comes next. At 154 knots, ease
            back on the elevator and lift off. Begin your pitch up
            to 20 degrees nose up at a rate of about 3 degrees per
            second. Some quick math tells us that it should take
            about six and a half to seven seconds to reach 20
            degrees nose up pitch attitude.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Positive Rate&#8212;Gear Up</p>

            <p>As you pitch up to 20 degrees with the wings level,
            scan the vertical speed indicator and the altimeter.
            When both instruments indicate a positive trend upwards
            (the needles moving up in the direction you want) we
            have a &quot;positive rate of climb&quot; and can safely retract
            the landing gear. Without establishing a positive rate,
            you do not want to retract the gear because you are too
            close to the ground and could inadvertently settle back
            to the runway for a variety of reasons&#8212;wind
            shear, rotation at too slow a speed, or too high a
            pitch attitude, alien force field (just kidding) to
            list a few. Retract the gear by pressing either the
            <strong>G</strong> key or the appropriate button on your
            joystick.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Retracting the Flaps</p>

            <p>On the initial phase of a departure, airlines follow
            an initial profile to guarantee terrain and obstacle
            clearance and sufficient climb performance in case of
            engine failure. To follow a similar procedure, you will
            want to be 400 feet above ground, with flaps still set
            at 5, and maintaining a speed of 180 knots. Your
            rotation rate to a pitch of 20 degrees nose up should
            take care of this. The second key element of the
            initial departure profile is to climb at an adequate
            rate of climb and airspeed until reaching a safe
            altitude of 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). At
            this point it is now safe to begin the after takeoff
            process.</p>

            <p>After reaching 1,000 feet AGL, follow the flap
            retraction schedule as shown on the Normal Takeoff
            profile. By 1,000 feet AGL you should be climbing at or
            above a speed of V2+15 (162+15). According to the
            schedule, it is now safe to begin flap retraction.
            Initially retract flaps from a setting of 5 to 1 by
            pressing the F6 key twice. Set the climb power to 90
            percent N1, pitch down to 15 degrees nose up, and
            accelerate. Above 2,500 feet AGL lower the nose to 10
            degrees to 12 degrees nose up and accelerate up to 250
            knots. As you accelerate through 200 knots, finish flap
            retraction. You might also want to follow the After
            Takeoff checklist.</p>

            between 280 knots and 300 knots. As you climb through
            higher altitudes, the air becomes less dense and
            performance changes. Keep an eye on your power setting
            of 90 percent N1 and make necessary adjustments to
            maintain 90 percent. As you climb through the higher
            altitudes, you may need to lower the pitch to 5 degrees

            <p>As you approach 1,000 feet prior to your target
            cruise altitude, lower the nose and maintain a climb
            rate of 1,500 feet per minute (fpm). As you pass
            through 150 feet prior to cruise altitude, begin your
            level off by pitching the nose down to 2 degrees nose
            up attitude and simultaneously reducing power to 70
            percent to 72 percent N1. Remember to retrim the

            coffee.</p><a name="Descending"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Descending</p>

            <p>We have covered the fundamental points involved in
            getting you airborne and leveled off at cruise
            altitude. Now you're wondering how you can descend and
            be in the right place at the right speed and altitude
            for landing. I've got an entire lesson for you on
            descents in ATP Lesson 2. But here's a brief overview
            to help you in this jet checkout lesson.</p>

            <p>When it comes time to begin a descent, you must
            complete several important tasks in order to be at the
            right place, at the right time. Prior to beginning the
            descent, air crews must complete the following.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Plan when to start descent.</li>

              <li>Get the ATIS and other information relating to
              the approach and landing.</li>

              <li>Calculate the estimated landing weight of the
              aircraft.</li>

              <li>Determine the flap setting and Vref speeds for
              landing.</li>

              <li>Determine the appropriate landing runway and
              corresponding approach.</li>

              <li>Brief the crew on the specifics of the
              approach.</li>

              <li>Complete the Descent checklist.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Fast is Too Fast?</p>

            <p>Speed control is one subtle piece of the equation.
            There are two places you will need to modify your
            profile to keep your speed within parameters: during
            descent as you descend into thicker denser air, and at
            the level off point where you may need to start slowing
            down to meet any assigned speed restriction, for
            example slowing to 250 knots.</p>

            <p>As you descend into thicker air, your indicated
            airspeed unit of measure will change from a percent of
            the speed of sound (Mach) back to nautical miles per
            hour (knots). You can determine this threshold by
            noticing the red and white striped pole or
            needle&#8212;known as the &quot;barber pole&quot;&#8212;displayed
            on the upper left side of the airspeed indicator. This
            needle marks the <strong>never exceed speed</strong> for the
            aircraft. During descent, the barber pole increases
            toward the needle of the airspeed indicator and left
            unattended, will eventually cross paths. Should this
            happen, you will have an overspeed condition as heard
            by the &quot;clicking/clacking&quot; audible warning (to say
            nothing of the gurgling and nail scratching sound from
            your copilot). To avoid this, reduce N1 to 45 percent
            and maintain 310 knots to 320 knots during the
            remainder of your descent.</p>

            <p>As you descend from cruise altitude, you will be
            storing up momentum as you descend at well over 300
            knots. All this works against you as you reach your
            target point and need to slow down. The fix is easy
            &#8230; and I don't mean you have your passengers stick
            their hands out the windows, either. During your
            descent planning, allow for an additional 5 nautical
            miles to level off and slow to your target speed at
            idle (yes, we can pull the throttles all the way to
            idle in a jet without having to worry about
            shock-cooling the engines as we did in the Baron). This
            might mean descending at nearly 300 knots, but then
            leveling at or above 10,000 feet, reducing power to
            flight idle, and coast in about 5 nm to bleed off speed
            until you reach 250 knots. At 250 knots, increase
            throttles to 52 percent to 55 percent N1 and maintain
            your 250 knots.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Planning for the Approach</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">ATIS</p>

            <p>The important elements to extract from the arrival
            airport's automatic terminal information service (ATIS)
            are: the local weather conditions, the local altimeter
            setting (what you'll set your altimeter to when
            descending below FL180), the active runway, and any
            local airport equipment limitations or runway/taxiway
            closures. Use this information to prepare for the
            approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Landing Weight</p>

            <p>Descent planning is usually done 100 miles to 120
            miles and approximately 20 to 25 minutes from landing.
            To estimate your landing weight, press <strong>ALT+A+F</strong>
            to get your present weight of fuel. Above 25,000 feet,
            a fair estimation is that you will burn 1,700 pounds of
            fuel during the remainder of your descent, approach,
            and landing. So subtract 1,700 pounds from your present
            weight. Next, add 100,000 pounds to this number to
            arrive at your estimated landing weight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Landing Flaps</p>

            <p>The selection of the desired setting for landing
            flaps is based upon a variety of issues including
            runway length, approach characteristics, runway
            condition, prevailing weather, and fuel efficiency.
            Following the theme of keeping it simple, we will
            standardize on using a flap setting of 30 for all our
            landings in the lessons.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Landing Vref Speeds</p>

            <p>During approach and landing, you will reduce
            airspeed along the way and never want to fall below the
            minimum airspeed for your current configuration. You
            always want to feel well grounded as a pilot, but not
            because you smacked the airplane onto the ground by not
            flying fast enough. For approach and landing, we are
            concerned with maintaining proper airspeed for the
            given flap setting and aircraft weight. If you are
            flying too slowly, the airplane will be difficult to
            control, or worse, could stall and contact the ground
            earlier than planned. Just like takeoff, there are
            predetermined airspeeds that will provide optimum
            performance and protection against stalls and other
            undesirable events. The airspeed that constitutes this
            threshold between controlled flight and
            less-than-controlled-flight is referred to as
            &quot;Vref.&quot;</p>

            <p>An additional 5 knots is added to this reference
            speed for added safety and best performance. So, once a
            Vref speed is determined given the aircraft's landing
            weight and desired flap setting for landing, the final
            approach landing speed will be Vref plus 5 knots. An
            additional 10 knots may be added (on top of Vref+5) to
            adjust for situations such as strong cross winds or
            potential wind shear. (Are you starting to think that
            flying that Skyhawk SP wasn't so bad after all? No one
            would blame you if you did. This is challenging but
            it's the way flying jets is done.)</p>

            <p>So when is all this figured out? During the descent
            planning phase, the flight crew calculates landing
            weight and chooses a desired flap setting. With the
            weight and flaps setting determined, the appropriate
            Vref speed can be identified.</p>

            <p>You most likely will not be tuning the radios and
            inbound courses at this point. This will be done when
            it is time for the Approach checklist. We still need to
            follow a standard arrival procedure or follow ATC
            instructions as the controllers vector us down from
            cruise altitude.</p><a name="The Approach"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Approach</p>

            <p>We've covered the basics of descent planning and
            speed control, so now it's time to transition into the
            airport environment. I offer an entire lesson on flying
            an ILS approach in ATP Lesson 3; here's an overview to
            get us to the runway. If you are flying using the ATC
            features in Flight Simulator, you will be radar
            &quot;vectored&quot; (given specific headings to fly) onto the
            final approach course. If you are flying on your own,
            you will need to plan to be at a certain altitude,
            speed, and heading in order to successfully intercept
            the final approach course properly configured.</p>

            <p>A rough rule of thumb for this approach transition
            is to plan on being 3,000 feet AGL at 10 nautical miles
            from the airport with the airplane properly configured
            and established on the localizer or VASI. Approaching
            this 10 nautical mile point you want to be slowed to no
            more than 170 knots with flaps set to 5. As the glide
            slope &quot;comes alive&quot; you will want to extend the gear,
            increase flaps to 15, and slow to 150 knots. At 3,000
            AGL and 10 nautical miles out, you should be close to
            intercepting (if not already on) the glide slope. Keep
            in mind that these are approximate altitudes and
            distances to place you close to a 3-degree descent path
            for final approach. At the final approach fix (FAF) set
            flaps 30 for landing, power to 53 percent to 55 percent
            N1, and fly the glide slope down to a smooth
            landing.</p>

            <p>Once you are established on the localizer with the
            glide slope indicator &quot;alive,&quot; configured with the gear
            down, flaps set to 15, and slowing to your target speed
            of 150 knots (or the appropriate Vref speed for your
            weight if you are going to that level of detail). You
            are ready to intercept the glide slope and fly it on
            down to the runway. At a point where the glideslope
            needle moves to one dot above center, set final landing
            flaps to 30 and set your power to 53 percent N1. Begin
            your pitch down to 0 degrees and monitor your position
            left or right relative to the localizer and high or low
            relative to the glide slope.</p>

            <p>As you cross the threshold of the runway for
            landing, reduce power to idle and begin a smooth pitch
            up to 3 degrees. This is called the &quot;landing flare.&quot;
            Hold this pitch setting as you bleed off the remaining
            airspeed and you will settle on the runway. Do not stop
            your small control corrections to keep lined up with
            the center line as you flare; fly the plane all the way
            down to the runway. Remember to line up the runway
            centerline with the letters &quot;GPS&quot; on the glare shield
            to keep tracking the centerline on touch down. Avoid
            the tendency to stare at the ground immediately in
            front of you. Transition your view to the end of the
            runway. As the main wheels touch, lower the nose wheel
            slowly. Apply reverse thrust (press and hold the
            <strong>F2</strong> key) and the brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD
            [.]</strong> key) to slow down and exit the runway at the
            next available intersection. You can also engage the
            autobraking features to further assist you in bring the
            aircraft to a stop after touchdown.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>All flap, speed, and power settings assume
                    default conditions of the Boeing 737&#8211;800
                    as set by Flight Simulator for &quot;Standard Day&quot;
                    conditions (15 C at sea level). As the
                    airplane's weight varies or the temperatures
                    vary, you may need to adjust some of these
                    items. This is why we use given ranges and not
                    specific values when operating the Boeing
                    737.</li>

                    <li>Remember that turbine engines do not
                    respond immediately to power changes (increases
                    or decreases). No amount of verbal coaching
                    like, &quot;Come on baby&quot; or &quot;Let's move it, I'm
                    talking to you mister,&quot; will help if you don't
                    think and plan ahead. If you are getting too
                    slow, you're already too late. If you think you
                    might soon be getting slow, then add power
                    now.</li>

                    <li>2 to 5 percent N1 power changes are
                    significant, but you will get the feel
                    quickly.</li>

                    <li>Two degrees of pitch change is
                    significant.</li>

                    <li>Level flight pitch is 5 to 6 degrees nose
                    up (at altitudes below 10,000 feet).</li>

                    <li>Remember to trim the aircraft every time
                    you change the configuration (power, flaps, or
                    gear). With power and pitch set to where you
                    want, you should be able to fly straight and
                    level with your hands off (off the controls,
                    that is. You still need hands. You can't fly
                    with your feet because other pilots wouldn't
                    want to touch the controls anymore).</li>

                    <li>On final approach, line up the runway
                    centerline with the <strong>NAV/GPS</strong> switch on
                    the top of the panel. As you cross the
                    threshold, line up the centerline with the
                    letters <strong>GPS</strong>.</li>

                    <li>Apply pitch and power settings and be
                    patient. This is a heavy turbine jet aircraft
                    and it doesn't respond quickly.</li>

                    <li>Use the autopilot if you like, but be very
                    familiar with operating it before relying on
                    it.</li>
