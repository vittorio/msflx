            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Autopilot Fundamentals</p>

            <p>The cockpit of the modern airplane has many useful
            things that can help you fly. No, I don't mean things
            like a copilot, either. I mean the autopilot. To a
            pilot, this is the most useful device in existence next
            to the coffee pot. And the day that an engineer
            develops an autopilot that makes coffee is the day that
            he or she will be raised to a god-like status. For now,
            these two devices are separate and we'll concentrate
            only on the autopilot in this lesson.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Autopilot Fundamentals</p>

            <p>Using the autopilot features available with the
            Boeing 737&#8211;800 for the first few times you fly
            the aircraft may add to your early success at flying
            the airplane. There are three main components of the
            autopilot: the flight director, the autothrottle, and
            the autopilot. Let's examine each one individually.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Director</p>

            <p>The flight director helps guide you along the
            correct course. Unlike an autopilot that physically
            flies the plane for you, the flight director provides
            guidance for applying the correction required to get
            back on course. You are still flying the airplane;
            however, when the flight director is activated, the
            flight director appears on the attitude direction
            indicator (ADI) as a set of bars, or crosshairs. The
            vertical bar shows deviations left or right of the
            intended course or centerline. The horizontal bar shows
            deviations above or below the target altitude or glide
            slope. In both cases, all you have to do is fly toward
            the bars to keep on the intended course.</p>

            <p>To enable the flight director, switch on the <strong>F/D
            ON</strong> toggle switch located on the left edge of the
            <strong>Mode Control Panel</strong> (MCP). Once enabled, select
            the level of flight director guidance by clicking on
            the button relating to the desired mode of use
            (<strong>NAV</strong>, <strong>HDG</strong>, <strong>APR</strong>, and so forth).</p>

                <td>Tracks the heading bug determined by the
                heading dialed in the <strong>HDG</strong> window.</td>

            </table>

            <p class="SubHead2">Autopilot</p>

            <p>The autopilot is the tool of choice when you want
            the airplane to fly itself. The autopilot provides the
            necessary automation to manage altitude, heading, and
            speed. Speed control is managed separate from heading
            and altitude via the auto throttle.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Autothrottles</p>

            <p>To have the airplane manage its own speed, turn on
            the auto throttle by selecting the <strong>A/T Arm</strong>
            switch on the left side of the MCP. To set the desired
            airspeed, click the <strong>IAS/MACH</strong> window toward the
            center of the MCP and enter in the desired airspeed.
            Once you have set the desired speed in the window,
            click the <strong>IAS</strong> button (for speed relative to
            nautical miles per hour). To set the desired speed in
            relation to percent of speed of sound, click the
            <strong>MACH</strong> button and make sure the value displayed in
            the window matches the desired value (e.g., 0.75).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Enabling the Autopilot</p>

            <p>With the simulation in or out of pause mode, set the
            desired values in the course, HDG, IAS, and Altitude
            windows. With the simulator out-of-pause, switch on the
            autopilot by clicking on the <strong>A/P CMD</strong> switch. To
            enable the autothrottle, click the <strong>A/T ARM</strong>
            switch on the left side of the MCP.</p>

            <p>There you have it. Once you get a little practice at
            using this wonderful little device you'll have a tool
            that does many of the wonderful things that copilots
            do. Unfortunately, you can't send the autopilot out to
            get you a cup of coffee, but I understand that the
            engineers are working on a solution to this problem as
            we speak.</p>
