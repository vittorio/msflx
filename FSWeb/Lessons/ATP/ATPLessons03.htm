            <p>Years ago a flight instructor was asked what the
            letters &quot;ATP&quot; meant. He replied, &quot;Always Totally
            Proficient.&quot; Well, it doesn't quite mean that, but the
            definition is close enough for our purposes. After this
            lesson you will be &quot;almost&quot; totally proficient in
            flying ILS approaches in the Boeing 737.</p>

            <p>This lesson will cover the details of making an ILS
            approach in the Boeing 737. In it, you'll have a chance
            to apply all that you've learned on the two previous
            ATP lessons. So let's begin at the beginning of the
            approach.</p><a name="Approach Self-Briefing"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Approach Self-Briefing</p>

            <p>Now that we know the local airport conditions, the
            local altimeter setting, and the expected active runway
            for arrival, we can begin to get organized for the
            approach. This is especially relevant since a major
            organ--your brain--is involved in this process. Now is
            the time to review the approach chart for the approach
            you'll fly. If you haven't done so already, this is an
            excellent time to use the autopilot to fly the plane
            while you focus your attention on the approach
            information. (You can read my brief article, <a href=
            "ATPLessons03Autopilot.htm">Autopilot Fundamentals</a>,
            or you can learn a lot more about it in the <strong>Learning
            Center</strong> article, <strong>Using the Autopilot</strong>.)</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The pre-approach briefing should take place prior
              to reaching the initial approach fix. Make sure you
              have the correct chart for the airport, runway and
              approach used.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key elements to briefing include the
            following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The airport elevation.</li>

              <li>The primary navigation aid and its
              frequency.</li>

              <li>The direction of the inbound course.</li>

              <li>The altitude at which the glide slope is
              intercepted.</li>

              <li>The name of the final approach fix.</li>

              <li>The minimum descent point (such as altitude, DME,
              or time, depending on the type of approach).</li>

              <li>The missed approach procedure.</li>

              <li>Any specific visibility requirements (such as 1
              mile or 5,000 feet).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You most likely will not be tuning the radios and
            setting inbound courses at this point. This will be
            done when it is time for the Approach checklist. We
            still need to follow a standard arrival procedure or
            follow ATC's instructions as they vector us down from
            cruise altitude.</p><a name="The Approach"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Approach</p>

            <p>We've already covered the basics of descent planning
            and speed control and now it's time to transition into
            the airport environment and land. As a Flight Simulator
            pilot equipped with the appropriate approach plates for
            the airport and runway, there is often a coverage gap
            in the charts between the end of an arrival and the
            entry to the charted approach procedure for the runway
            of choice. If you are flying using the ATC features in
            Flight Simulator, you will be radar &quot;vectored&quot; (given
            specific headings to fly) onto the final approach
            course. If you are flying without ATC, you will need to
            plan to be at a certain altitude, speed, and heading in
            order to successfully intercept the final approach
            course properly configured.</p>

              </tr>
            </table>


            <p>A rough rule of thumb for this approach transition
            area is to plan to be 3,000 feet AGL at 10 nautical
            miles (nm) from the airport, while properly configured
            and established on the localizer. Approaching this 10
            nm point you want to be slowed to no more than 170
            knots with flaps set to 5. (Shown in Figure 3-1) As the
            glide slope &quot;comes alive&quot; (starts moving away from a
            full deflection) you will want to extend the gear,
            increase flaps to 15, and slow to 160 knots. At 3,000
            AGL and 10 nm out, you should be close to intercepting,
            if not on, the glide slope.</p> 
			
			<p>Keep in mind that these are approximate altitudes and
            distances to place you close to a 3 degree descent path
            for final approach. Each approach is different to allow
            for items such as terrain or ground obstructions. At
            the final approach fix (FAF) set flaps 30 for landing,
            set power between 53 percent and 55 percent N1, and fly
            the glide slope down to a smooth landing.</p>

            <p>Whether you are being vectored by ATC or have
            followed your own descent path, the key to a successful
            approach and landing is being prepared. This means you
            have the right chart out for the approach (as you have
            already done during your descent checklist right?) and
            have tuned the radios to the correct frequencies and
            set the inbound course. Briefing yourself on the
            approach procedure and key altitudes is important, as
            is having the proper mental image of the procedure so
            that you can stay ahead of the approach.</p><a name=

            <p>Once you're established on the localizer with the
            glide slope indicator &quot;alive,&quot; configured with the gear
            down, flaps set to 15, and slowing to your target speed
            of 150 knots (or the appropriate Vref speed for your
            weight, if you are going to that level of detail), you
            are ready to intercept the glide slope and fly it on
            down to the runway. At the point of glide slope
            intercept from below where you're still &quot;one dot low&quot;
            (as shown in Figure 3-2) with the glide slope needle
            moving downward, set the final landing flaps to 30 and
            set your power to about 53 percent N1. Begin your pitch
            down to 0 degrees and monitor your position left or
            right relative to the localizer and high or low
            relative to the glide slope.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Tracking an ILS</p>

            <p>The best way to fly an ILS approach with the needles
            centered is to be properly configured, trimmed, and on
            speed at the final approach fix. To correct flight path
            deviations, make frequent, small corrections when
            tracking the localizer and glide slope. Waiting too
            long to fix a deviation will send you into &quot;pilot
            induced oscillation&quot; getting you farther behind the
            process. It could also result in knocking down a few
            trees by not remaining on glide slope.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Tracking the Glide Slope</p>

            <p>If you are above the glide slope with the pitch set
            correctly at 0 degrees, then reduce your pitch to
            recapture the glide slope while simultaneously reducing
            power by 1 percent to 2 percent N1 to keep your
            airspeed from increasing. If you are below the glide
            slope with the pitch set correctly at 0 degrees, then
            increase your pitch slightly to recapture the glide
            slope while simultaneously adding power (1 to 2 percent
            N1) to keep your airspeed from decreasing. The secret
            to recapturing a wayward glide slope needle is to make
            pitch and power changes simultaneously. This helps you
            maintain the desired airspeed during the recapture. If
            you're on glide slope and your airspeed is either too
            high or too low, then make a 1 to 2 percent N1 power
            adjustment while moving your elevator to maintain the
            desired pitch. If your pitch is not stabilized, you
            will have a difficult time capturing and staying on the
            glide slope. If you maintain the configuration, pitch,
            and power settings provided, use small power
            adjustments to maintain the glide slope.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Tracking the Localizer</p>

            <p>If you are left of the localizer course but on
            heading: turn right 2 degrees, level the wings and be
            patient. As you recapture the localizer, turn back to
            your inbound course. Use the opposite technique if you
            are to the right of course. If you are 2 dots or more
            off centerline, turn to a heading up to 5 degrees off
            the inbound course, and level the wings. Use the width
            of the heading bug to limit the degrees of correction
            to use. It's wise to avoid banking more than half of a
            standard rate turn when making course corrections on an
            ILS. Again, make small changes and have patience.</p>

            <p>You can also get a lot of help learning to fly an
            ILS from the Flight Director mode on the autopilot.
            I'll let you read about that on your own.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Instrument Scan</p>

            <p>Making small, frequent corrections means you will
            need to scan your instruments rapidly, as you learned
            in the instrument rating lessons. The technique for
            scanning instruments in the Boeing 737 is a little
            different than the Cessna Skyhawk, but your earlier
            training should help a lot here.</p>

            <p>The primary instrument to use as the center point is
            the artificial horizon, or the attitude direction
            indicator (ADI) in this aircraft. The goal is to start
            at the ADI, reference the other key instruments one at
            a time, returning to the ADI. HSI refers to the
            Horizontal Situation Indicator; VSI refers to the
            Vertical Speed Indicator.</p>

                  </table>

                  <p>One scan pattern that works well for the
                  Boeing 737 is the following:</p>

                  <p>ADI, VSI, ADI (1, 2, 1)<br>
                  ADI, HSI, ADI (1, 3, 1)<br>
                  ADI, VSI, ADI (1, 2, 1)<br>
                  ADI, Airspeed Indicator, ADI ( 1, 4, 1)<br>
                  ADI, VSI, ADI (1, 2, 1)<br>
                  ADI, N1 percent, ADI (1, 5, 1)<br>
                  ADI, VSI, ADI (1, 2, 1)<br>
                  ADI, Altimeter, ADI (1, 6, 1)</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Try not to fixate on any one instrument. Take a
            mental snap shot of the instrument as you return your
            scan to the ADI. Apply required corrections as you scan
            other instruments: this is the fun part. Skip
            instruments you do not need to scan. If your airspeed
            is where you want it and stabilized, you can skip the
            N1 percent check in that round.</p>

            <p>As you near the approach end of the runway, the
            localizer and glide slope needles will be more
            sensitive (so don't make fun of them). These needles
            will show a change faster than when you began the
            approach. Resist the temptation to apply big
            corrections down near the bottom of the ILS. Use the
            same small, but frequent corrections and you will keep
            ahead of the process.</p>

            <p>So, a properly configured and well trimmed airplane
            is easy to fly. Remember to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Set N1 percent power in the specified range</li>

              <li>Use the target speeds as recommended</li>

              <li>Use the flap settings specified</li>

              <li>Fly the pitch as recommended</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By keeping those four points in mind, the needles
            will move slowly and be easy to correct.</p>

            <p>You might also want to review (and perhaps print)
            the approach and landing quick reference tables:
            <a href=
            "ATPLessons01TableStraightinVisualApproach.htm">Straight-in
            Visual Approach</a> and <a href=
            "ATPLessons01TableHowToLandAnILSApproach.htm">How to
            Land</a>.</p>

            <p>Does it get any better than this? Maybe, but you
            have to admit that flying an ILS approach in the Boeing
            737 is a wonderful experience. I think you're ready to
            give this ILS lesson a try. So have at it. Just
            remember that it takes practice to get good at
            anything. So feel free to review this ground school
            lesson as many times as you desire and print the quick
            reference tables. Suppose that during the ILS, the
            localizer and glide slope needles keep hitting their
            stops as they race up, down, right and left. If this
            happens it's possible that one of your passengers might
            say, &quot;Hey, I think you left your turn signal on.&quot; If
            you hear this, don't be embarrassed. Just keep
            repeating this lesson until those needles remain steady
            during the approach. That's called learning.</p>
