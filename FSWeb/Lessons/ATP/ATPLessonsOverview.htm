            Airline Transport Pilot Certificate
          </div>

          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>Most commercial airline pilots who fly jets have an
            Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate. This is the
            pinnacle in acquiring your Flight Simulator aviator
            skills. Learn how to fly in the Boeing 737&#8211;800
            jet. It takes some dedication and commitment, but the
            rewards are worth it. Up for the challenge? Follow
            these steps:</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Airline Transport Pilot (ATP)</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 1: Jet checkout</p>

            <p>Take off from Seattle-Tacoma International airport.
            Climb to 12,000 feet, perform some turns, descend back
            toward Seattle, and land at the same airport from which
            you departed.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 2: Descents and energy
            management</p>

            <p>Starting at Flight Level 280 (28,000 feet), plan
            your descent to cross the Paine VOR at precisely 8,000
            feet. It takes planning and constant calculating to
            take a fast moving jet from cruise flight to the
            approach phase of the flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 3: Full ILS approach</p>

            <p>Fly a full ILS approach, which includes a course
            reversal maneuver called a procedure turn. Combining
            the complexities of the approach, bad weather, and a
            busy cockpit make this a challenging lesson.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">ATP solo flights</p>

            <p>To help you prepare for your checkride, practice the
            skills the examiner will be looking for during the
            flight. The solo flights will help you develop your
            takeoff, landing, descent, and instrument approach
            skills.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">ATP Checkride</p>

            <p>Put all the ATP skills together in a flight from
            Portland, Oregon to Boeing Field in Seattle,
            Washington. You'll takeoff, climb to cruise altitude,
            plan your descent, and fly a full ILS approach into
            Boeing field. The weather will present challenges, as
            will all the Boeing 737 cockpit duties. When you pass
            this checkride, you'll receive the Flight Simulator ATP
            certificate.</p>
