            <p>Imagine sitting on the back of a mean rodeo bull as
            the gates open and the audience cheers. You're holding
            on for dear life, ruing the day you gave up being a
            vegetarian. The stakes are high because the big steak
            you're riding is in rare form and in a mighty bad mood.
            After what seems like hours of trying to steer the
            steer, you're ejected from the beast and your life
            saved by rodeo clowns.</p>

            <p>What does this have to with flying a jet? Without a
            good understanding of energy management, you'll
            probably feel something similar to riding a wild bull
            when trying to get a jet down and stopped on a runway.
            The only thing missing from this scenario will be the
            rodeo clowns. Like riding a steer, controlling a jet
            means understanding how to manage its
            energy.</p><a name="Descents"></a>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Descents</p>

            <p>We have covered the fundamental points involved in
            getting you airborne and leveled off at cruise
            altitude. Now you're wondering how you can descend and
            be in the right place at the right speed and altitude
            for landing. When it comes time to begin the descent,
            you must complete several important tasks in order to
            end up at the right place and at the right time. Prior
            to actually beginning the descent, air crews must
            complete the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Plan when to start the descent.</li>

              <li>Get the ATIS and other information relating to
              the approach and landing.</li>

              <li>Calculate (or estimate) the landing weight of the
              aircraft.</li>

              <li>Determine the flap setting and Vref speeds for
              landing.</li>

              <li>Determine the appropriate landing runway and
              approach desired.</li>

              <li>Brief the crew on the specifics of the
              approach.</li>

              <li>Complete the Descent checklist.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead2">Descent Planning</p>

            <p>Descent planning is not a trivial matter. It
            requires some expertise&#8212;but we will show you the
            basics required to get the most enjoyment from your
            Flight Simulator experience. So here's the lowdown on
            getting down.</p>

            <p>Aircraft equipped with turbine engines achieve their
            best performance at high altitudes where the air is
            thin and fuel consumption is low. Jets like to climb
            high quickly, and remain there for as long as possible.
            Although it may be better for the airplane's
            performance, a steep high-speed descent is not the most
            enjoyable experience for passengers. So, alas, we must
            find a way to descend from altitude at a more
            comfortable rate. After all, during the descent the
            last thing you want your passengers to do is throw
            their hands over their heads like they would on a wild
            rollercoaster ride, right?</p>

            <p>Air crews flying large jets at high altitudes like
            to descend using the 3:1 principle. That is, for every
            3 nautical miles (nm) traveled forward, they descend
            1,000 feet. This rate produces the same 3-degree glide
            slope you typically use on final approach. There are
            two key components to descent planning: 1) When to
            start descent, and 2) Which rate of descent to use.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">When Do I Start My Descent?</p>

            <p>To figure out when you should start down from your
            cruising altitude, you need to know the point and the
            altitude where you'd like to be along your route. For
            simple VFR flight, you might want to be at traffic
            pattern altitude (1,500 AGL) as you enter the pattern.
            Commercial airliners often must follow an IFR Standard
            Terminal Arrival Route procedure (or STAR&#8212;which,
            by the way, isn't only used at night) that dictates the
            altitude and speed at which you need to be at points
            along the specified route. For example, a STAR might
            request that you descend to cross the 30 DME fix from
            the ABC VOR at 10,000 feet and maintain 250 knots (I
            guess we could call this a <em>falling star</em>, but we
            won't).</p>

            <p>To figure out your starting point, or &quot;Top of
            Descent,&quot; while following the 3:1 rule, subtract your
            target altitude from your current altitude and multiply
            this answer by three. This will give you the number of
            miles from your target that you need to start your
            descent. Consider the following examples:</p>

            <p>If we are flying at 8,500 feet and want to be at
            1,500 feet at the airport, calculate your descent point
            as follows:</p>

                <td>Nautical miles from the airport</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Here's another simple way to calculate this in your
            head. Once you know the altitude you want to lose in
            the descent, multiply it by three to determine the
            miles from the fix you should be. We'll use this during
            the lesson to monitor our progress during the descent,
            which will then tell us if we need to make adjustments
            along the way.</p>

            <p>According to our STAR instructions example above, if
            we were cruising at 28,000 feet and needed to be at
            10,000 feet 30 miles from the VOR, our calculations
            would be as follows:</p>

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Here comes the fun part of this example (and no
            rodeo clowns are involved). We need to begin our
            descent 54 nm from our target destination
            point&#8212;the 30 DME fix from the ABC VOR. This means
            we need to add in the additional 30 nm to this 54 nm
            figure and start our descent 84 nm (54 nm + 30 DME)
            from the ABC VOR.</p>

            <p>You can have a lot of fun calculating descent points
            and then flying them to check your assumptions. The
            next important element of the equation is the actual
            rate of descent you use during the descent profile.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">What Rate of Descent Will Get Me
            There?</p>

            <p>Using the right rate of descent in feet per minute
            (fpm) will be the key to arriving at your target
            destination at the proper altitude. In order to
            maintain our 3:1 descent profile, we can calculate the
            required rate of descent by multiplying our estimated
            ground speed for descent by six.</p>

            class="SideBarTable" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <p><strong>To determine your ground speed</strong></p>

                  <p>Look in the upper left corner of the Nav display.

            </table>

            <p>But how will you know what your ground speed will be
            in the descent before you descend? Our profile initial
            descent speed from altitude will be approximately 0.74
            Mach (or about 400 knots ground speed). So, you can use
            400 knots as your initial ground speed during descent
            and calculate the required rate of descent by
            multiplying 400 (knots) by 6 to get 2,400 fpm.</p>

            <p>So, in our example above, at 84 nm from the ABC VOR,
            begin a 2,400 fpm descent.</p>

            <p>In cruise, you have been traveling at around 400
            knots with N1 set at around 71 percent. For descent,
            initially reduce your N1 to 60 percent to 62 percent to
            keep from over speeding the aircraft.</p>

            <p>A very quick way to estimate your descent rate is to
            consider the following:</p>

            <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1"
            cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#003366" class=
            "article-bodycopy" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
                <td>Above 25,000 feet</td>

                <td>300 knots at 2,500 fpm</td>
              </tr>

              <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF" valign="top">
                <td rowspan="2">Below 15,000 feet</td>

                <td>250 knots at 1,700 fpm</td>
              </tr>

              <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF" valign="top">
                <td>200 knots at 1,400 fpm</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Fast is Too Fast?</p>

            <p>A subtle piece of the equation is speed control.
            There are two places you will need to modify your
            profile to keep within parameters: during descent as
            you descend into thicker denser air, and at the level
            off point where you may need to start slowing down to
            meet any assigned speed restriction (for example,
            slowing to 250 knots).</p>

            <p>Now, it's very important to remember the FAA
            regulation that limits airspeed to no more than 250
            knots when you are below 10,000 feet. In the lesson,
            we'll stay below this airspeed, but it'll be important
            to remember on your checkride.</p>

            <p>As you descend into thicker air, your airspeed unit
            of measure will change from a percent of the speed of
            sound (Mach) back to knots. To prevent a close shave by
            flying too fast when it's not appropriate to do so, you
            can determine this threshold by noticing the &quot;barber
            pole&quot;&#8212;the red and white striped pole, or needle,
            displayed on the upper left side of the airspeed
            indicator. This needle marks the &quot;never exceed speed&quot;
            for the aircraft. During descent, the barber pole
            increases toward the needle of the airspeed indicator
            and left unattended, will eventually cross paths.
            Should this happen, you will have an over-speed
            condition on your hands as marked by the
            &quot;click-clacking&quot; audible warning, which also sounds
            like the copilot's chattering teeth because he's quite
            nervous by now. To avoid this, reduce N1 to 45 percent
            and maintain 310 to 320 knots during the remainder of
            your descent.</p>

            <p>As you descend from cruise altitude, you will be
            storing up all kinds of kinetic energy as you go
            swooping down at more than 300 knots. All this works
            against you as you reach your target point and need to
            slow down. The solution is easy. During your descent
            planning, allow for an additional 5 nm to level off and
            slow to your target speed at idle. In our example
            above, this would mean beginning your descent at 89 nm
            from the ABC VOR, arriving at 10,000 feet 35 miles from
            the VOR. Once leveled at 10,000 feet, reduce power to
            flight idle and coast the 5 nm bleeding off speed until
            you reach 250 knots. At this point, increase throttles
            to N1 of 52 to 55 percent and maintain 250 knots.</p>

                  <p>Remember that as you descend below FL 180
                  (18,000 feet) you need to reset your altimeter
                  from 29.92 inches to the local pressure setting,

            <p>And now a word of warning from your sponsor--me. If
            you have been using the autopilot with autothrottles
            enabled, you may not slow down in time to meet your
            crossing restriction. In the second example above, the
            autothrottles will get you slowed to 250 knots, but not
            by the 30 DME fix. Typically, the autothrottles can
            take as much as 7 minutes to slow down. You can cover a
            large distance in this amount of time. Without access
            to the Flight Management System (FMS), the best way to
            handle this is to disengage autothrottles as you level
            at the 5-nm lead point and set power to flight idle
            manually. Optionally, you can use a 10-nm lead point to
            account for the extra time and distance required for
            autothrottles to slow down.</p>

            <p>Of course, as a last resort, you can always deploy
            the spoilers (or speed brakes) by pressing the <strong>SLASH
            (/)</strong> key. With careful planning, such as the above
            steps, you should be in fine position for your approach
            and landing profiles.</p>

            <p>Now you are an energy manager because the 3:1 rule
            on descent planning is true for any plane you fly, such
            as the Cessna Skyhawk and Beechcraft Baron 58, and at
            lower altitudes and airspeeds. Perhaps I should now
            call you the <em>all-being, master of space, time, and
            dimension</em> because so few people ever master energy,
            much less master it in a Boeing 737. OK, I won't call
            you that yet. All I'll say is give this lesson a try
            and practice the principles you've learned here. More
            power to you!</p>
