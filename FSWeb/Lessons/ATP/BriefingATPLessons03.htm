            <p>In this lesson, you'll learn to fly a full ILS
            approach in the Boeing 737.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE</p>

            <p>25 minutes</p>

            <p class="SubHead">REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE/SKILLS</p>

            <p>You should complete all Student, Private,
            Commercial, and Instrument lessons before beginning
            this lesson. Reading the Ground School material before
            starting this lesson will help you better understand
            the skills being taught and terminology used in the
            lesson.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">THE WEATHER</p>

            <p>You'll encounter mostly cloudy conditions with some
            rain. Low ceilings are forecasted, so you will need to
            fly the aircraft referring only to the instruments.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">RECOMMENDED CHARTS</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href=
              "../images/KBFI_ILS_13R.jpg">Chart</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">ABOUT THE FLIGHT</p>

            <p>In this lesson you will fly a descent and full ILS
            approach into Boeing Field. You can either hand-fly the
            lesson or use the autopilot for the entire lesson. This
            lesson does not teach using the autopilot, so you must
            bring those skills to the lesson if you choose to use
            the autopilot.</p>

            <p>Notes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>You'll need to be familiar with how to adjust the
              CDI in this aircraft.</li>

              <li>You'll need to know how to tune the radios,
              including changing frequencies between the active and
              standby positions.</li>

              <li>You may want to have a pad of paper and pencil
              handy for quick calculations and to copy your
              clearance. You may also want to print the approach
              chart.</li>

              <li>This lesson assumes you know how to use the
              autopilot (if you elect to use it) or are proficient
              with precise pitch, speed, and altitude control of
              the aircraft.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">KEY COMMANDS TO REMEMBER</p>

            <p><strong>F7</strong> to operate the flaps<br>
            <strong>G</strong> to operate the landing gear<br>
            <strong>Shift + / (slash)</strong> to arm spoilers</p>

            <p class="SubHead">FLIGHT CRITERIA</p>

            <p>You'll be asked to maintain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Airspeed within 15 knots as assigned</li>

              <li>Altitude within 200 feet as assigned</li>

              <li>Headings within 10 degrees as assigned</li>

              <li>Power settings within no more than 2% above and
              no less than 5% below N1 as assigned</li>

              <li>Pitch attitude within 3 degrees as assigned
              except on landing flare, where pitch angle should be
              no more than 5 degrees and no less than 2 degrees
              nose-up pitch attitude</li>

              <li>Vertical speed within 400 feet per minute during
