            <p class="deck">&#8212;by Rod Machado</p>

            <p>&quot;Before you can learn to run, you must learn to
            walk.&quot; That's what my grandfather always told me.</p>

            <p>If my grandfather were a flight instructor (he's
            not), I'm sure he would have said, &quot;Before you can
            learn to fly, you must learn to taxi.&quot; He would have
            been right, too. Here are a few taxi tips you should be
            familiar with before you go charging off into the wild
            blue yonder.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Taxi Thoughts</p>

            <p>Airplanes are often graceful birds in the air. On
            the ground, however, they're clumsy&#8212;kind of like
            an albatross. To put it simply, they aren't meant to
            spend a lot of time on the ground. Therefore, engineers
            don't design them with all the creature comforts you'd
            expect of a ground-bound vehicle. You shouldn't expect
            to find power steering in your Cessna 172, for
            instance. You will, however, find pedals on the floor
            of the cockpit in a real airplane. These are how you'll
            steer the airplane during taxi.</p>

            <p>Taxiing is rather easy. If your system is equipped
            with rudder pedals, simply push one or the other to
            turn the airplane. (If you've got rudder action built
            into your joystick, just twist the joystick, and it
            will have the same effect as pedals. Hopefully, if you
            twist your joystick, it will be the twistable type.
            Don't twist it if there is no control feature
            associated with the twist, otherwise your joystick will
            come off in your hands which will make it a &quot;no-joy
            stick.&quot; Assuming that your joystick does not twist, use
            the <strong>0</strong> key on your numeric keypad for left rudder
            and the keypad's <strong>ENTER</strong> key for right rudder.)
            Pushing a pedal deflects the airplane's nose gear in
            the same direction, causing the airplane to turn. For
            example, pushing the right pedal makes the airplane
            turn to the right. Once airborne, the airplane's nose
            gear extends into a position that prevents it from
            turning. When this occurs, pushing a rudder pedal
            deflects the rudder and not the nose gear.</p>

            <p>If you don't have rudder pedals, then life is much
            simpler for you. You steer by deflecting the joystick.
            The airplane turns in the direction the joystick is
            deflected. It doesn't get any easier than that.</p>

            <p>A word of caution: You want to avoid taxiing fast.
            The faster you taxi, the easier it is to have the
            airplane do something you don't want it to do.
            Tricycle-gear airplanes, for example, are unstable when
            they have to stop quickly. Anyone who has ever ridden a
            child's tricycle knows this. One quick stop or too
            sharp a turn causes the tricycle to topple over. It's
            the same with airplanes. As a general rule, you don't
            want to taxi faster than you can walk. Of course, if
            everyone walked with the stride of Wilt Chamberlain,
            the pilots would have more patience during taxiing. Try
            to taxi slowly.</p>

            <p>You do this by using only enough power to start the
            airplane moving and then reducing it to about 1,000
            rpm. If the airplane starts moving too quickly, then
            reduce the power to idle and apply the brakes. Slow the
            airplane down to an acceptable taxi speed, and continue
            as before.</p>

            <p>Taxiing the airplane is the easy part of this
            process. The difficult part is figuring out how to get
            where you want to go on the airport. You can't just
            head out across the airport unless you know something
            about taxiway and runway markings. If you're at an
            airport with an operating control tower, then you need
            to contact ground control for permission to taxi.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Airport Markings</p>

            <p>Have you ever wondered what all those small trucks
            at airports&#8212;the ones with the flashing yellow
            lights&#8212;do? I thought I knew. For a long time, I
            was convinced they brought sandwiches to the student
            pilots who became lost on the airfield. After all, even
            students need sustenance while attempting to navigate
            from taxiway to runway to parking spot.</p>

            <p>An airport's signage and markings are one situation
            in which consistency makes for confidence, and the FAA
            lends a helping airfoil by specifying in great detail
            how airport runways, taxiways, and other aircraft
            movement areas are to be laid out, marked, and lit.
            While it's not quite true that if you've seen one
            airport you've seen 'em all, there is a method to the
            apparent madness. Just like a Buck Rogers secret
            decoder ring, you have to decipher what's in front of
            you.</p>

            <p>Let's take a look at Chino, California, shown in
            Figure 1.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1 The old airport
                layout at Chino.<br>
                (A new runway is not shown.)</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The airport is graced with two runways capable of
            handling takeoffs and landings in four different
            directions (two directions on each of the two runways,
            for the geographically challenged).</p>

            <p>Since Chino is a tower airport and since controllers
            get upset when you land on a different runway from the
            one they had in mind, it's helpful to know that runways
            come with numbers, which are always large and painted
            in white. Runway numbers and their markings help
            distinguish them from the airport's nonlanding
            surfaces. Chino's runways are numbered 8, 26, 21, and
            3.</p>

            <p>You think they just make those numbers up, don't
            you? I had a student who thought runway numbers were
            based on some sort of speed limit or seismograph
            record. Uh huh. The numbers represent the first two
            digits of the runway's actual three-digit magnetic
            direction. Essentially, a runway's numbers are its
            direction, rounded off to the nearest 10 degrees. A
            runway oriented at 211 degrees becomes Runway 21
            (pronounced &quot;runway two-one&quot; when speaking to
            controllers and other aviation-savvy people). A runway
            pointed 076 degrees becomes Runway 8 (rounding up).</p>

            <p>There are two sides to almost every issue and two
            ends to every runway. With rare exceptions (usually
            having to do with terrain), you can theoretically land
            or take off from either end. This means each piece of
            runway pavement has numbers on each end. Those who are
            way ahead of me will realize these numbers, when
            expressed as three-digit figures, differ by a value of
            180. Makes sense, since the two directions are 180
            degrees apart.</p>

            <p>All runway angles are oriented to the magnetic North
            Pole, where the magnetic compass points, and not the
            true North Pole, where Santa Claus (a pilot) lives.
            When your airplane is pointed down any runway, the
            airplane's magnetic compass should approximately
            indicate that runway's direction. Figure 2 shows what
            the compass and the directional gyro might look like
            when aligned with Runway 26 at Chino.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>Remember that when operating at an airport: wind
            direction, landing direction, and any headings ATC asks
            you to fly are all based on magnetic direction.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Runway Lighting</p>

            <p>Painted white, runway markings are easy to identify
            during the day, but what about at night? Don't look for
            fluorescent orange any time soon. The airport has an
            image to maintain. Besides, the airport would become a
            magnet for rock stars and flower-painted Volkswagen
            buses if those colors were used.</p>

            <p>The answer at night is light. As the sun sinks
            slowly into the west, the airport often lights up like
            one of those amusement park parades. All kinds and
            colors of lights, some flashing and some steady, are
            there to amuse and confuse you. Think of it as
            color-coded hints, and you'll be on the right
            track.</p>

            <p>White lights, shown in Figure 3, border both sides
            of the runway.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson7Figure03.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3 Basic runway
                lighting.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Called runway edge lighting, these lights are spaced
            200 feet apart. Controllers turn these lights on
            between sunset and sunrise or when visibility is
            poor.</p>

            <p>The beginning of the runway is announced with green
            threshold lights, while the far end of the runway is
            lit in red. It's an appropriate color to indicate you
            are running out of usable landing surface (only
            tractors, bulldozers, and dune buggies beyond those red
            lights, please!). These lights actually lead a dual
            life. On one side they're green; on the other, red.
            Think about it for a second. The beginning (or
            threshold) of one runway is the end of another. The
            lights on the threshold of Runway 21 are also at the
            terminus of Runway 3.</p>

            <p>What I've described so far are the basics of runway
            lighting, which you will encounter at almost any
            airport that supports night operations. It can and does
            get a lot fancier. While gathering aviation experience,
            you're sure to come across airports with sophisticated
            lighting. In fact, airports with precision-instrument
            runways can have such detailed lighting that it's
            possible to mistake it for a prairie fire. Some runways
            have centerline lighting with embedded lights running
            the entire length of the runway centerline. Some have
            brilliant, sequenced, flashing strobe lights leading to
            the runway threshold. Others have touchdown zone
            lighting, which looks like a gigantic Christmas tree
            was squished into the first 3,000 feet of the runway.
            One of my students said it was so pretty, he wasn't
            sure he should land on it. You can! See the U.S.
            Department of Transportation's <em>Aeronautical
            Information Manual (known by pilots as &quot;the AIM&quot;)</em>
            for additional information on these lighting
            systems.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Taxiway Markings</p>

            <p>There are few things as pitiful as a pilot on the
            ground, even in the daytime. The King or Queen of the
            Airways can easily become the Lost Platoon when the
            gear hits the ground. It is a common misconception that
            pilots are endowed with some superior ability to find
            their way around airports. This is demonstrably untrue.
            Most pilots can find a vending machine blindfolded, but
            many of us have trouble getting from the runway to the
            tie-down spot at an unfamiliar airport. Pilots and
            their airplanes have been extracted from some rather
            unusual places (like the time a fellow pilot
            accidentally taxied into a secret military hangar at a
            combo civilian/military airport. It obviously wasn't
            much of a secret, since they were in the habit of
            leaving their doors open).</p>

            <p>Figure 4 shows a drawing of taxiway markings from an
            airport chart.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            <p>Taxiway D (Delta) parallels the north side of Runway
            8-26, and Taxiway C (Charlie) parallels the northwest
            side of Runway 3-21. There are several intersecting
            taxiways with individual phonetic names.</p>

            <p>At larger airports, and even at smaller ones when
            ground traffic or construction exists, it's not unusual
            for a tower controller to offer a complex taxi
            clearance.</p>

            <p>Here's such a clearance: &quot;November 2132 Bravo, taxi
            to Runway 21 via Charlie, southwest to Delta, turn
            left; cross Runway 21 and make a left turn on Golf,
            over.&quot; Students normally respond to this clearance with
            a, &quot;Huh?&quot; If you had an airport chart out, you could
            easily navigate from position A1 to position A2 in
            Figure 4 without getting lost. Many varieties of
            airport charts (similar to the one in Figure 4) are
            available to make airport-ground navigation easier.</p>

            <p>Taxiways are identified by a continuous yellow line
            with parallel double yellow lines on the outer edges of
            the taxi surface (Figure 5).</p>

            <p>Taxiway names are shown by small signs. Placed along

            lettering on a black background. Signs containing black
            lettering on a yellow background indicate the position
            of intersecting taxiways. Arrows indicate the relative
            direction of these intersecting taxiways. At night,
            many (not necessarily all) taxiways have blue
            omnidirectional sideline lighting (Figure 6).</p>

            <p>At some airports, taxiways may have embedded green
            centerline lighting. One time, I caught an empathetic
            and sensitive student of mine weaving between the
            embedded green taxiway lights. I thought she was having
            a flashback until I found out that she was afraid of
            damaging either the lights or the tires. You won't hurt
            the lights or the tires, but feel free (if you wish) to
            keep the nosewheel a few inches to the side of the
            embedded lighting.</p>

            <p>As a pilot, you must be able to identify the point
            where the taxiway ends and the runway begins. This
            transition is identified by four yellow lines&#8212;two
            solid and two dashed&#8212;crossing perpendicular to
            the taxiway and running parallel to the runway (Figure
            7), known as runway-hold markings.</p>

            <p>If the two solid lines are on your side, then, at a
            tower-controlled airport, a clearance is required to
            enter the runway. If the double dashed lines are on
            your side, then you should cross those lines to clear
            the runway and enter the taxiway. (From now on, we'll
            assume that a &quot;controlled airport&quot; is one having an
            operating control tower.)</p>

            <p>Assuming you have just landed and are taxiing off
            the runway, you should taxi across the double dashed
            lines and clear the runway. The FAA assumes that your
            airplane hasn't cleared the runway until the entire
            airplane (down to the last rivet) is on the other side
            of those double dashed yellow lines. The reason for
            this is to prevent the tails of long airplanes (like a
            stretched DC-8) from poking out onto the runway. This
            could make landing quite challenging for another pilot
            and possibly give him or her an extra EKG blip.</p>

            <p>At airports without an operating control tower
            (meaning the airport has no control tower or the tower
            has shut down for the night), entering an active runway
            is done at the discretion of the pilot. (From now on,
            an airport having no control tower or one at which the
            tower is not in operation will be referred to as an
            uncontrolled airport.) In this instance, you should
            hold short of the runway, behind the solid taxiway-hold
            lines. Taxi onto the runway only when it's clear of
            traffic and when no airplanes are getting ready to land
            (known as being &quot;on a short final&quot;). In other words,
            &quot;Look carefully before taxiing onto the runway.&quot; The
            last thing you want is for someone to do a touch and go
            on you. And, making another pilot go around won't win
            you too many friends at the airport. It's also a good
            idea to broadcast your intentions on something known as
            the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) when no
            tower is in operation. This lets other pilots in the
            traffic pattern know what you're doing. More on this
            later.</p>

            <p>Another way to identify where the runway begins is
            with a white-on-red sign located next to the dashed and
            solid double yellow lines (shown in Figure 7). These
            informational billboards are called runway-holding
            signs, though they don't actually hold anything. They
            exist to inform you when you're about to enter an
            active runway. They also indicate the runway direction.
            In Figure 7, <strong>30-12</strong> indicates Runway 30 is to the
            left and Runway 12 is to the right (in other words, go
            to the left to find the beginning of Runway 30, and so
            on.). At controlled airports, these signs are your cue
            to hold your position unless a clearance has been given
            to enter or cross the runway. Figure 8 shows a single
            runway holding sign indicating that the taxiway
            intersects the beginning of the takeoff runway.</p>

            <p>At uncontrolled airports, the runway-hold signs
            indicate that you can proceed across or onto the runway
            when you've assured yourself no traffic conflict
            exists. (An airplane preparing to take off or land is
            most definitely a conflict.) At a tower-controlled
            airport, these signs are coupled with the double solid
            and dashed taxiway-hold lines, providing ample warning
            that you're crossing into the action area.</p>

            <p>Some airports may have taxiways that interfere with
            the runway safety area, like those shown in Figure 8.
            Taxiway Delta is located directly behind the beginning
            of Runway 15. Airplanes landing on Runway 15 could
            approach low enough to present a problem to both the
            approaching and taxiing airplanes. This is more likely
            to be a problem for big airplanes, but the rules take
            into account the worst-case scenario. Holding-position
            signs for this peripheral runway are shown by
            white-on-red lettering. The term <strong>15APCH</strong> next to
            the solid double yellow lines indicates a mandatory
            hold point at tower-controlled airports (this means any
            aircraft on the following taxiway might affect aircraft
            on approach to Runway 15). On the opposite side of the
            runway, on Taxiway Delta, on the back side of the
            runway-hold sign, is a runway safety area sign
            (normally found only at tower-controlled airports).
            This consists of the same markings shown on the taxiway
            (double solid and dashed lines). These signs can be
            used as a guide in deciding when to report back to a
            controller that you are clear of the runway. Remember,
            at uncontrolled airports, pilots must decide for
            themselves whether to enter or cross a runway.</p>

            <p>It's difficult, but not impossible, for pilots to
            accidentally taxi onto an active runway at a
            tower-controlled airport. One pilot at a busy airport
            once taxied right into the middle of an active runway
            and just sat there (probably waiting for one of those
            yellow trucks to bring him a sandwich). Completely
            confused about the tower's directions and unwilling to
            ask for clarification, he stopped his airplane while a
            jet was on final approach. The tower controller said,
            &quot;32 Bravo, do you know where you are?&quot; The pilot
            replied, &quot;Burbank Airport?&quot; The controller said, &quot;Yes,
            that's good, but do you see that big Boeing 707 out
            there on final approach headed directly for you?&quot; The
            pilot replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Do you want him to do a touch
            and go on you?&quot; The pilot replied, &quot;No.&quot; The controller
            said, &quot;Then you'd better get off his runway.&quot; The
            pilot, not wanting to get bounced on by a Boeing 707,
            immediately exited the runway.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Additional Runway Markings</p>

            <p>Just because there is concrete in the shape of a
            runway doesn't mean that it can be used for landing.
            Some runways have yellow chevrons painted on them
            (Figure 9, position A).</p>

            <p>This signals that the surface is unsuitable for
            taxiing, taking off, or landing. It's basically an
            airplane no man's land. Don't use any portion of this
            area. It might be off-limits because the surface won't
            support the weight of an airplane even for taxiing, let
            alone landing, or because the surface is otherwise
            unsuitable. Planes that venture onto chevrons can find
            themselves up to their axles in asphalt and trapped
            like a gigantic insect on flypaper.</p>

            <p>White arrows pointing in one direction form what is
            called a displaced threshold (Figure 9, position B).
            This is a runway area that is not to be used for
            landing, but on which you can taxi, take off, or roll
            out after landing. Displaced thresholds often exist as
            part of a noise abatement effort. By forcing you to
            land farther down the runway, you maintain a higher
            altitude on the approach than you would if landing at
            the beginning of the runway. A displaced threshold can
            exist for other reasons, such as the presence of a
            surface that will support the weight of an airplane,
            but not the impact of an airplane landing. (There's a
            big difference. I know this since one of my instructors
            used to call out Richter scale values following my
            touchdowns.)</p>

            <p>I won't mention any names, but on occasion,
            professional airline pilots have been known to land at
            the wrong airport with a full load of passengers.
            Nothing like bringing your own audience to a faux pas.
            Several years ago, a pilot did this at an East Coast
            airport. He accidentally landed at a small training
            field with nothing but itty-bitty Cessnas and Pipers
            fluttering around the pattern. As he touched down and
            came to a stop, his wheels punched holes in the thin
            runway surface. He knew he was in trouble when it took
            full power just to taxi. A few of the locals came out
            and said, &quot;Hey! Look what you did to our runway! You
            put divots in it. Geesh!&quot; The only way they could get
            the airplane out was to completely strip it down to
            bare-bones metal, making it light enough to take off
            without further runway damage. The same could not be
            said for the pilot's career.</p>

            <p>Now it's time for you to practice taxiing on Paine
            Field. Use the airport diagram to help find your way
