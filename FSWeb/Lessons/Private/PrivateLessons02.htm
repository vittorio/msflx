            <p>I like steep turns! They're fun, challenging, and,
            in many cases, they are a good test of a pilot's
            ability to recognize the limits of airplane
            performance. And, if you play Microsoft&#174; Combat
            Flight Simulator, they're useful to get away from a
            bandit who is trying to shoot your tail off!</p>

            <p>Steep turns (those typically done between 45 and 55
            degrees of bank) are used to develop flight
            proficiency. Practice them often, and you'll find
            yourself becoming smoother on the flight controls.
            Steep turns also help you learn to handle the natural
            division of attention that accompanies such a
            high-performance maneuver.</p>

            <p>There's another benefit of which you may not be
            aware. Steep turns demonstrate that airplanes have
            limits and exceeding those limits has a cost. Making
            too steep a turn can result in a stall. This isn't
            necessarily dangerous if you're several thousand feet
            above the ground. However, don't try making a steep
            turn to align yourself with the runway when you're at a
            low altitude with insufficient airspeed. This is a
            sure-fire way to get into a new line of work, like
            geology. You'll really get into it&#8212;about six feet
            deep into it.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Steep Turn Aerodynamics</p>

            <p>First, a little review: In an earlier lesson, you
            learned that banking the wings allows lift to pull the
            airplane sideways. The airplane turns because some of
            its lifting force acts in the horizontal direction.</p>

            <p>Of course, once an object is set in motion, it wants
            to remain in motion. A fellow named Newton said that
            (that's Isaac, not Wayne). When an airplane turns, its
            entire mass still wants to maintain its original
            direction. That's why you feel yourself forced down in
            your seat on a roller coaster when the track changes
            direction. The roller coaster is changing directions,
            but your body wants to continue moving straight ahead.
            Coupled with the downward pull of the earth, you feel
            like you'll go right through the roller coaster's
            seat.</p>

            <p>Although airplanes don't fly on tracks, you'll feel
            a similar force pulling you down in your seat when
            making a steep coordinated turn. The steeper the turn,
            the greater the seat-pulling force. This force is
            sometimes called the G-force (or load factor). The &quot;g&quot;
            in G-force is derived from the word &quot;gravity&quot; and has
            nothing to do with the sound passengers make when they
            feel themselves forced down in their seats during steep
            turns: &quot;Gee!&quot;</p>

            <p>G-force is a predictable force for all airplanes.
            Figure 2-1 shows a graph representing the increase in
            G-force for a given bank.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson9Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-1 Load Factor
                chart</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The example shows that in a 60-degree bank, you and
            the airplane will feel a G-force of 2 (two Gs). In
            other words, you and the airplane feel like you weigh
            twice as much as you normally do. Imagine that. You
            experience an apparent increase in weight, all without
            letting even one bag of greasy fries slip past those
            disciplined lips of yours. Of course, you can lose that
            weight by rolling out of the turn back into
            straight-and-level flight, where you'll feel a G-force
            of 1-just like you feel right now (which is determined
            by how many fries you've eaten up till this point in
            your life).</p>

            <p>Here's the catch: If you and the airplane feel
            heavier because of an increase in G-force, then you,
            the pilot, must compensate for the artificial weight
            increase. You must increase the airplane's lift if it
            is to keep flying. Without compensating for this, the
            airplane won't be able to maintain altitude in a steep
            turn. In fact, it can even stall. And you don't want to
            become known as a pilot who stalls whenever he or she
            makes a steep turn. Imagine the kind of nickname you'd
            get for that: Imelda Impact, Steve Splatdown, or Chris
            Crater.</p>

            <p>Increasing lift in a steep turn means that you must
            increase the angle of attack by applying back pressure
            on the joystick. Lift must equal weight&#8212;real
            weight or apparent weight&#8212;if the airplane is to
            remain flying. That's why steep banks require large
            angles of attack to produce the lift necessary for
            flight. You see what's coming, right?</p>

            <p>If you make too steep a turn, the airplane may reach
            its critical angle of attack before producing
            sufficient lift for flight, and the airplane will
            stall. Now you're forced to recover from the stall
            before you can continue flying.</p>

            <p>You've just learned that an airplane's stall speed
            increases in a steep turn. While you may stall at 50
            knots in straight-and-level flight, you may need 70
            knots to keep from stalling when turning steeply.
            Figure 2-2 is another graph, which allows you to
            predict this increase in stall speed based on an
            increase in G-force.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson9Figure02.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-2 Stall speed and
                bank angle chart.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>For example, in a 60-degree bank, the airplane and
            its contents experience 2 Gs (that's a G-force of 2).
            Figure 2-2 shows that 2 Gs give you a 40 percent
            increase in stall speed. Therefore, an airplane
            stalling at 50 knots in level flight will stall at 70
            knots in a 60-degree bank (40 percent of 50 added to
            50).</p>

            <p>Here's what this means to you. If you're planning on
            doing a steep turn at 60 degrees of bank, you'd better
            have an airspeed of at least 70 knots if you want to
            avoid a stall. Isn't that amazing? You made a
            prediction and didn't need to peek at a magic crystal
            ball, throw bones, or read tea leaves (you can save
            these things for weather predictions).</p>

            <p>That's why you'll need to add additional power when
            doing steep turns. In most cases, this provides the
            necessary increase in speed that helps prevent a stall.
            Of course, if your airplane doesn't have a big engine,
            then it may not be able to produce the thrust necessary
            to keep the speed high enough to prevent a stall during
            a steep turn. Well, I remember going to a doctor and
            saying, &quot;Doctor, it hurts when I do this!&quot; Her advice,
            of course, was &quot;Don't do that.&quot;</p>

            <p>If you don't have sufficient power, then you can't
            go around making really steep turns. And the author's
            decision is final on that.</p>

            <p>Don't worry about technique right now. You want to
            examine the aerodynamics first, and then we'll talk
            about the art of making turns.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">What This Means to You</p>

            <p>It appears that you need a six-degree nose-up
            attitude to hold your altitude in this turn. Since your
            angle of attack increased, more of the wing's underside
            is exposed to the airstream. This creates more
            lift&#8212;but also more drag. Thus, the airplane slows
            down a bit, as shown on the airspeed indicator.</p>

            <p>So, here's a problem for you:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A steep turn with a constant altitude is
              accompanied by a decrease in airspeed.</li>

              <li>Coupled with an increase in stall speed, you may
              find yourself caught between the proverbial rock and
              a hard place if you're not careful.</li>

              <li>As the stall speed increases and the airspeed
              decreases, the two may eventually meet.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What happens then? Yes, the airplane stalls. How
            might you prevent this in a steep turn? Try adding
            power to prevent airspeed loss. Once again, don't worry
            about making beautiful steep turns yet; ugly ducklings
            are fine for right now. Hack your way through it, and
            I'll teach you the proper steps to the dance in a
            bit.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Two G or Not To G</p>

            <p>Suppose you roll into a 45-degree bank and add full
            power. What will happen? You'll notice that the
            increase in power allows the airplane to maintain its
            airspeed. There you have it. A nice steep turn without
            a decrease in airspeed is possible as long as you have
            sufficient power. But suppose the turn is really steep?
            Let's say it's at 60 degrees of bank. At this bank
            angle, your stall speed increases from 50 knots to 70
            knots. The question is, &quot;Do you have enough power to
            keep the airspeed above 70 knots in a 60-degree bank
            turn?&quot; The only way to find out is to try and
            experiment with this at a safe altitude. When you do
            this experiment, you'll find that the airspeed will
            decrease, even with full power. Why? Because small
            airplanes just don't have the extra power to overcome
            the enormous increase in drag associated with the
            required increase in angle of attack.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Tough Part</p>

            <p>Here's where pilots often get themselves into
            trouble. When maneuvering for landing with power at
            idle, they make steep turns to align themselves with
            the runway. Given their slow speed and steep bank, the
            airspeed and stall speed converge. In other words,
            while in a steep turn, the stall speed increases
            because of increasing G-force and the airspeed
            decreases because of increasing drag. When the airspeed
            and stall speed meet, the airplane stalls. If this
            happens close to the ground, it's a really bad deal.
            You'll often hear this type of stall called an
            accelerated stall. It's accelerated because of the high
            G-force caused by a steep turn.</p>

            <p>Okay, enough science, Mr. Spock. Time for artistry.
            Let's talk about how to make classy steep turns.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">A Touch of Class Before You're Out
            of Gas</p>

            <p>One secret to making a good steep turn is to have a
            predetermined idea of the attitude necessary to hold
            altitude in that turn. While there are many variables
            affecting this, you can still approximate it. Normally,
            you'd also use outside visual references while doing
            steep turns in an airplane. This allows you to keep a
            lookout for other airplanes, as well as identify the
            airplane's attitude. Using outside visual references
            for steep turns, however, is a little tough to do in a
            simulator, so you'll focus on the attitude indicator
            instead.</p>

            <p>Take a look at Figure 2-3.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson9Figure03.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 2-3</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>This is the approximate attitude necessary for a
            turn at 45 degrees of bank. As you roll into the turn,
            you'll need to progressively increase the pitch until
            you reach a 6-degree nose-up attitude. Then, you should
            use the altimeter to determine what type of small pitch
            correction is necessary to hold altitude. You can also
            use the VSI as an additional source of information, if
            you like. The secret is to make small corrections and
            always keep an eye on your attitude.</p>

            <p>Overcorrection is sure to send you wandering all
            over the sky as you try returning to your assigned
            altitude. A steep turn is considered acceptable by
            private pilot standards when the following things are
            all true:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Your altitude doesn't vary more than 100
              feet.</li>

              <li>The heading on rollout is within 10 degrees of
              the direction you started with.</li>

              <li>The bank varies no more than 5 degrees.</li>

              <li>The airspeed remains within 10 knots of the entry
              speed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's one other thing you should be aware of when
            doing steep turns. Pulling back on the joystick tends
            to increase the bank a little. That's why you must be
            careful not to let the bank increase during a steep
            turn. This is a rather common occurrence when applying
            back pressure on the joystick. Additionally, at steep
            bank angles, airplanes have a natural tendency to
            steepen their bank without the pilot doing anything to
            cause this. Once again, be prepared to compensate for
            this with aileron pressure if necessary. Therefore, in
            a steep turn, especially when applying back pressure to
            maintain altitude, you might need to apply a little
            opposite aileron with the joystick to prevent
            overbanking.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you're wondering why I haven't mentioned
            anything about trimming during the steep turn. The
            reason is that we only use trim to hold the controls in
            one place for a relatively long period of time. Since
            steep turns are transitory, trim isn't normally used.
            Besides, steep turns help you to recognize the onset of
            an accelerated stall. In the actual airplane, you can
            feel yourself being forced down in the seat by
            increasing G-force. You can't feel this in a simulator.
            Therefore, you must rely on the back pressure you're
            applying to the joystick to warn you of an approaching
            stall at higher airspeeds. This is another good reason
            not to trim in steep turns.</p>

            <p>You're now qualified to try steep turns at larger
            banks. When you practice them in the Interactive
            Lesson, go all the way to 55 degrees, which is the bank
            required for commercial license certification. Roll
            into and out of the turns while holding altitude within
            100 feet, airspeed within 10 knots, and rollout
            headings within 10 degrees of the entry direction. Have
            as much fun as you can!</p>
