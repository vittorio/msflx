            <p>Just as on a busy highway, the tremendous volume of
            aircraft flying the skies today requires traffic
            management. Someone has to be in control of where all
            those aircraft are flying, at what altitude and speed,
            and by what route. The task falls to the various air
            traffic control agencies located in nearly every
            country around the world. Air traffic control is a
            vital component in the safety and economy of the
            nations of the world. Without a system to keep things
            moving safely, people and goods cannot be transported
            efficiently in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>Please take this opportunity to read the Air Traffic
            Control articles in the Learning Center. On the left
            side of the screen, click <strong>Learning Center</strong>.
            Scroll down, if necessary, and click the <strong>Air Traffic
            Control</strong> link, which will take you to an index of
            all ATC articles.</p>

            <p>When you're familiar with ATC, return to here and
            click on the <strong>Fly This Lesson Now</strong> link to
            practice what you just learned.</p>
