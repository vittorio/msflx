            <p>Airplanes are like homing pigeons: they all have a
            particular place to go. In the case of airplanes, it's
            the airport. For homing pigeons, they head&#8230; home.
            With all those airplanes heading for airports (in some
            cases, the same airport), it's amazing that they don't
            bump into one another more often.</p>

            <p>In the spirit of the homing pigeon, I guess you
            could say that pilots pull off quite a &quot;coo&quot; in how
            they manage to do this safely. The fact is, pilots are
            highly organized when they operate at airports. They
            don't fly around in a chaotic manner like moths around
            search lights. They fly a rectangular pattern relative
            to the runway, and they do it at a specific altitude.
            This pattern is formally called a traffic pattern, and
            it allows pilots to know where to look for and expect
            other aviators that are operating at the airport. It's
            also the pattern you'll fly when you want to practice
            your takeoffs and landings. Let's have a closer look at
            how to fly the traffic pattern.</p>

            <p>Flying around an airport is done in precise, careful
            ways so we don't run into each other and so we set
            ourselves up for good landings, aligned with the
            runway. This approach and alignment with the runway is
            called a traffic pattern&#8212;a rectangular pattern as
            shown in Figure 4-1.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson10Figure01.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 4-1 The traffic
                pattern</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The traffic pattern has five major legs, or
            segments:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>The departure leg</li>

              <li>The crosswind leg</li>

              <li>The downwind leg</li>

              <li>The base leg</li>

              <li>The final approach</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let's review each segment and discuss its purpose.
            And since we can imagine this any place we want, why
            not imagine ourselves at the beautiful Honolulu
            airport?</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Departure Leg</p>

            <p>The departure leg is the takeoff, which we've
            already covered. I guess you could say that we're off
            to a good start since we already have a leg to stand
            on.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Crosswind Leg</p>

            <p>Since you'll remain in the traffic pattern for
            training, you'll make a 90-degree left turn (most
            traffic patterns use left turns) to the crosswind leg.
            This portion of the pattern is called the crosswind leg
            because the flight path is perpendicular to the runway
            and generally crosswise to the wind direction. Make
            this turn when the airplane is beyond the departure end
            of the runway and within 300 feet of traffic pattern
            altitude (TPA). (TPA is the maximum altitude at which
            you'll fly the pattern.) For this ground school class,
            let's set the pattern at 1,000 feet MSL which puts you
            approximately 1,000 feet above the ground (and the
            water, too, so watch out for flying fish.)</p>

            <p>Throughout the departure and crosswind legs (and
            sometimes part of the downwind leg, too), the airplane
            may continue to climb until reaching traffic pattern
            altitude. This depends on how close you fly the
            pattern, as well as airplane performance, runway
            length, and the number of hula dancers you have in the
            airplane with you. If you reach TPA while you're still
            on the crosswind leg, then level the airplane at 1,000
            feet, accelerate to 90 to 95 knots, reduce the rpm to
            2000, and trim. It's also best to limit your turns to
            no more than 30 degrees of bank while operating in the
            pattern. This is no time to practice your combat turn
            techniques; save 'em for Microsoft&#174; Combat Flight
            Simulator.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Downwind Leg</p>

            <p>As the airplane continues on the crosswind leg,
            another 90-degree turn is made. This places the
            airplane parallel to the runway, going opposite the
            direction in which it will land. This is called the
            downwind leg (Figure 4-1) because you're now going with
            the wind instead of into it.</p>

            <p>Fly the downwind leg at between half a mile and one
            mile out from the landing runway. There are several
            reasons for this. First, this position allows you to
            remain comfortably close to the runway. That way, in
            the event of an engine problem, you can glide to a safe
            landing on the runway instead of ending up in someone's
            lobster trap. Second, it keeps you close enough to the
            runway so you can see it easily. It makes no sense to
            fly so far from the side of the runway that it looks
            like the end of a tiny matchbox. Being closer means you
            can more easily estimate wind drift and make the
            necessary wind corrections.</p>

            <p>The problem is, how do you know when to begin the
            downwind turn? There are several ways to do this. In an
            actual airplane, you can look out the left window and
            estimate the distance. You can also do the same in
            Flight Simulator by selecting the side window view long
            enough to view the runway, and then switching back to
            the forward view. (Or, you could use the handy Virtual
            Cockpit feature we discussed earlier. Neat, huh?) You
            can also guess the distance by doing a little math. At
            60 knots ground speed, the airplane covers one nautical
            mile in one minute. Therefore, you'd want to begin the
            downwind turn anywhere between 30 and 60 seconds after
            turning crosswind. Since your airplane is climbing at
            75 knots (75 knots ground speed assumed), you'll want
            to begin the turn sooner, perhaps between 24 and 48
            seconds after turning crosswind. Perhaps the easiest
            way is to use Flight Simulator's Top-Down view to
            estimate the turning point.</p>

            <p>Finally, how do you know what direction to fly the
            downwind leg? That's an easy answer. Fly a heading
            exactly opposite of that used for takeoff. Without
            doing any math, just look at the number shown at the
            bottom of the heading indicator when you're aligned
            with the runway. That's the heading you'll fly on the
            downwind leg.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Preparing for the Base Leg Turn</p>

            <p>You'll continue downwind until passing a point abeam
            the threshold of the landing runway. At this point, you
            want to begin preparation for landing by applying 10
            degrees of flaps. (Make sure you're below 95 knots when
            applying flaps. The end of the white arc on the
            airspeed indicator is the airplane's maximum
            flap-extension speed.)</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"

              <tr>

                    <li>When you are abeam of the end of the

                    altitude.</li>

                    <li>Trim the airplane.</li>
                  </ol>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Remember, don't use trim to change the pitch. That's
            what the joystick's for. Use trim to take the pressure
            off the joystick once the desired attitude is
            established.</p>

            <p>It's important to hold your altitude on the downwind
            leg. After all, airplanes are entering the pattern on
            the downwind leg, and a premature descent from TPA
            could result in a landing on top of someone's airplane
            (perhaps this is how biplanes were invented).</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Base Leg</p>

            <p>Now it's time for another 90-degree turn to the
            left. We call this base leg, and from here you have
            only one more 90-degree turn before you're on final
            approach. But where should you start your turn to base
            leg?</p>

            <p>Assuming airplane traffic isn't a factor, it's
            convenient and practical to start your turn onto base
            leg when the landing threshold appears about 45 degrees
            between the wing (left wing in this instance) and the
            tail of your airplane. In other words, as you look out
            the left window, the runway's threshold appears to be
            at a 45-degree angle to the left of the wing (or midway
            between the wing and the tail), as shown in Figure
            4-2.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            <p>This provides for a symmetrical, rectangular traffic
            pattern, instead of one having the shape of an enormous
            amoeba. Additionally, it provides you with enough
            distance from the runway to make a comfortable
            approach.</p>

            <p>Yes, if you need to, you can look out the left
            window to estimate when you're in the position to turn
            onto the base leg. However, you might be better off
            using Flight Simulator's Top-Down view to estimate the
            turning point, as shown in Figure 4-3.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            <p>Base leg is a point of transition for landing. It's
            the place where important adjustments are made in the
            airplane's speed and landing configuration. This is
            why, even when you're not following other traffic
            (airplanes) on the downwind leg, you should avoid
            turning base too early. Things happen mighty fast as
            you approach the runway. You want to give yourself
            enough time to adjust your airspeed, flaps, and glide
            path. That's why I recommend you give yourself a final
            approach length of at least a mile. Sometimes, it's
            preferable to modify the pattern and fly the downwind
            leg long enough so you'll have a final approach length
            of two miles. Assuming that you aren't following other
            airplanes in the pattern (or being followed), a longer
            final approach gives you much more time to configure
            the airplane for landing. When I'm introducing a pilot
            to a new and perhaps faster airplane, I typically tend
            to prefer to fly a longer final approach.</p>

            <p>The descent for landing is normally started on the
            base leg and continues throughout the final approach.
            Here's the sequence:</p>

            <p>When the airplane is in the desired position to
            begin the base leg turn (as you look straight down in
            Top-Down view), make a 90-degree turn to the left. To
            easily identify the proper heading to fly, look at the
            heading that is 90 degrees to the left of the downwind
            heading. That's the heading to fly on the base leg.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Roll out on this heading.</li>

              <li>Reduce power to flight idle.</li>

              <li>Establish a glide at 70 knots.<br>
              (When possible, I like to use a speed 40 percent
              above the no-flap stall speed on base leg).</li>

              <li>Make sure you trim for 70 knots.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Now you're ready to intercept the final approach
            leg.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Final Approach</p>

            <p>The final approach (sometimes just called final) is
            a critical part of the landing sequence. Generally, a
            square turn from the base leg onto final approach is
            best. This provides you with enough time to observe and
            modify your airplane's descent path and alignment with
            the runway. During the final approach, the airplane is
            configured for landing and the speed is adjusted for
            the final approach speed (usually 30 percent above the
            airplane's present stall speed). Once the airplane is
            established and stabilized on a final approach descent,
            you're now in a position to estimate whether or not
            your glide path is too high, too low, or just perfect
            for landing on the desired portion of the runway.</p>

            <p>When turning from base leg onto final approach, you
            have an opportunity to correct your glide path for any
            obvious indications of being too high or too low.</p>

            <p>Let's assume that you are making a power-off
            approach from the base leg. After turning base, you
            reduced the power and commenced a descent. Let's also
            assume that your objective is to land on a specific
            spot on the runway. If you're too low, you can cut
            short the turn from the base leg to final approach, as
            shown in Figure 4-4.</p>

            nice, square turn onto final.</p>

            <p>If you're too high, you can deliberately overshoot
            the turn onto final approach, giving you more distance

            <p>S-turns are a series of alternating turns left and
            right of the direct glide path. (They may make it look
            like you've had one too many Mai Tais!) Since the
            shortest distance between any two points is a straight
            line, anything you do to fly other than a straight line
            lengthens the trip. Assuming a constant rate of
            descent, taking the long way home will allow you to
            lose more altitude.</p>

            <p>Once you're lined up on final approach, establish a
            speed of 65 knots (if you decide to use 20 or 30
            degrees of flaps, I recommend an approach speed of 60
            knots). Don't forget to trim. Now you're ready to
            handle the landing from here! Click the <strong>Fly This
            Lesson Now</strong> link to practice what you just
            learned.</p>
