            <p class="LessonSubHead2">First, a Little Theory</p>

            <p>In our class on slow flight, I showed you how, in
            order to maintain sufficient lift for flight, the
            wing's angle of attack increased as the airspeed
            decreased. Perhaps you've wondered if there is a limit
            to how much the angle of attack could increase. After
            all, common sense suggests there are limits to all
            things. The ancient Egyptians had common-sense limits,
            especially regarding the size of pyramids they could
            build (I think this is known as Tutankh-common sense).
            Wings have limits, too.</p>

            <p>A pilot's job is to work the four forces, maintain
            lift, and avoid the burbling air condition that results
            in a stall. As I mentioned in a previous lesson, this
            kind of stalling has nothing to do with the engine
            stopping.</p>

            <p>Air begins to burble over the top of the wing when
            the wing reaches a large angle of attack (about 18
            degrees for most airplanes). This burbling disrupts the
            flow of air over the wing, interfering with lift and
            causing a stall. The angle at which the air begins
            burbling followed by the wings stalling is known as the
            critical angle of attack.</p>

            <p>Okay, here comes an idea that's like the biggest
            fish you ever caught&#8212;it's a real keeper. Since
            wings always stall when they exceed the critical angle
            of attack, you can recover from the stall by decreasing
            the angle of attack to less than the critical value.
            Everybody got that? Repeat it to yourselves 10 times,
            fast.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Stall, Angle of Attack, and How the
            Nose Knows</p>

            <p>To get a handle on how a stall happens, think of air
            molecules as little race cars moving over the wing
            (Figure 1-1).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson8Figure01.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-1 Angle of
                Attack.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Each car (and air molecule) has one objective: To
            follow the curve over the wing's upper cambered
            surface. Of course, if the wing is at a low angle of
            attack, the curve is not sharp, and it's a pretty easy
            trip (Figure 1-1).</p>

            <p>But look at the curve made by these cars and air
            molecules when the wing is attacking the wind at a
            large angle. As the angle of attack exceeds
            approximately 18 degrees (known as the critical angle
            of attack for reasons you will soon see), these
            speed-racer air molecules can't negotiate the turn
            (Figure 1-1).</p>

            <p>When this happens, they spin off, or burble, into
            the free air, no longer providing a uniform,
            high-velocity, laminar airflow over the wing (Figure
            1-2). The wing stalls.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-2 A Wing that is
                Stalled..</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Remember, according to Jacob Bernoulli,
            lower-velocity airflow over the wing produces less
            lift. There is still impact lift provided by air
            molecules striking the underside of the wing, but we've
            already learned this doesn't provide nearly enough lift
            to sustain the airplane. When there's less lift than
            weight, bad things happen to good airplanes. The wing
            goes on strike and stalls. Abandoned by Bernoulli,
            gravity summons the airplane to earth on its own
            terms.</p>

            <p>All wings have a critical angle of attack (the angle
            varies slightly among airplanes). Beyond this angle,
            the wing and the wind don't work and play well
            together. All the whispered theory in your heart won't
            overcome the laws of physics and aerodynamics. The wing
            police are always watching. Exceed the critical angle
            of attack, and the air molecules won't give you a lift.
            Sounds serious&#8212;and it can be. Fortunately,
            there's a readily available solution, and it is not
            screaming, &quot;Here, you take it!&quot; to the instructor. At
            this point, I'd like you to put your finger in your
            ear. Why? Because I'm about to say something really
            important and I don't want it to go in one ear and out
            the other. Here comes the important stuff again: You
            can unstall a wing by reducing the angle of attack. You
            do this by gently lowering the nose of the airplane
            using the elevator control (Figures 1-3A and 1-3B).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson8Figure03.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-3 Stalling and
                exceeding the critical angle of attack.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Easy does it here, Tiger. Once the angle of attack
            is less than its critical angle, the air molecules flow
            smoothly again over the top of the wing and production
            of lift resumes. It's as simple as that. Now the
            airplane can resume flying and doing what airplanes are
            supposed to do (Figures 1-3C and 1-3D). Please don't
            ever forget this. Okay, you can take your finger out of
            your ear now.</p>

            <p>Why am I making such a big deal out of this? Because
            in a moment of stress (having the wing stop flying
            creates stress for many pilots), you will be inclined
            to do exactly the opposite of what will help. Pilots
            have a natural inclination to pull or push on the
            elevator control to change the airplane's pitch
            attitude. During a stall, as the airplane pitches
            downward, your untrained instinct is to pull back on
            the elevator control. You could yank that critter back
            into your lap, and the result will not be good. The
            wing will remain stalled, and you, my friend, will have
            the look of a just-gelded bull.</p>

            <p>If the wing stalls, you need to do one very
            important thing: Reduce the angle of attack to less
            than its critical value. Only then does the wing begin
            flying again. Adding full power also helps in the
            recovery process by accelerating the airplane. The
            increase in forward speed provided by power also helps
            reduce the angle of attack.</p>

            <p>Don't just sit there with stalled wings. There's a
            reason why you are called the pilot in command. Do
            something. But do the right thing.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Stall at Any Attitude or
            Airspeed</p>

            <p>You should realize that airplanes can be stalled at
            any attitude or at any airspeed. Put your finger back
            in your ear. It makes no difference whether the nose is
            pointed up or down or whether you are traveling at 60
            knots or 160 knots. Whether an airplane exceeds its
            critical angle of attack is independent of attitude or
            airspeed. Figure 1-4A shows one instance of how this
            might happen.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson8Figure04.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 1-4 Stall recovery
                when exceeding the critical angle of

            </table>

            <p>Airplanes have inertia, meaning they want to keep on
            moving in the direction they are traveling. Airplane A
            is pointed nose down, diving at 150 knots (don't try
            this at home!). The pilot pulled back too aggressively,
            forcing the wings to exceed their critical angle of
            attack, and the airplane stalled. Wow! Imagine that. It
            stalls nose-down at 150 knots! Figure 1-4B shows an
            instance of an airplane stalling at 100 knots in level
            flight after the pilot pulled too abruptly on the
            elevator control.</p>

            <p>What must the pilot do to recover? The first step is
            to decrease the angle of attack by moving the elevator
            control forward or by releasing back pressure on the
            joystick (remember, pulling back on the elevator
            control was probably responsible for the large angle of
            attack that induced the stall in the first place.) This
            re-establishes the smooth, high-velocity flow of air
            over the wings. The airplane is once again flying.</p>

            <p>The second step (if necessary) requires applying all
            available power to accelerate the airplane and help
            reduce the angle of attack.</p>

            <p>Once the airplane is no longer stalled, it should be
            put back in the desired attitude while making sure you
            don't stall again. Stalling after you've just recovered
            from a previous stall is known as a secondary stall.
            Unlike secondary school, it is not considered a step
            up, especially by the participating flight instructor.
            (You'll know your instructor is unhappy when you hear
            her make subtle statements like, &quot;Hmm, come to think of
            it, childbirth wasn't all that painful.&quot;)</p>

            <p>Stalling an airplane intentionally, at a safe
            altitude, is actually fun, or at least educational.
            Stalls are relatively gentle maneuvers in most
            airplanes. Stalling an airplane close to the ground,
            however, is serious business because it is usually not
            an intentional act. During flight training, you'll have
            ample practice in stall recovery.</p>

            <p>Managing a stalled airplane is one thing; managing
            your natural instincts, however, is another. For
            example, a typical stall trap you could (literally)
            fall into involves a high sink rate (that is, a high
            rate of descent) during landing. While on approach, you
            might apply back pressure on the elevator attempting to
            shallow the descent. If you exceed the critical angle
            of attack, the airplane will stall. The runway now
            expands in your windshield like a low-orbit view of a
            supernova.</p>

            <p>If you follow your untrained instincts and continue
            to pull backwards on the elevator, the stall deepens.
            Trained pilots know better. They are aware of the
            possibility of stalling and apply the appropriate
            combination of elevator back pressure and power during
            landing to change the airplane's glide path without
            exceeding the critical angle of attack. (Your
            instructor will show you the appropriate use of
            elevator and power during landing). How do pilots know
            the proper amount of rearward movement to apply to the
            elevator? How do they know they won't stall the
            airplane?</p>

            <p>If there was an angle-of-attack indicator in your
            airplane, stall recognition would be easy. You'd simply
            keep the angle of attack less than what's critical for
            that wing. Angle-of-attack indicators, although
            valuable, are rare in small airplanes. In Flight
            Simulator, the main clue you have to the onset of a
            stall is the stall horn, which will activate when
            you're a few knots above stall speed. You'll also have
            the luxury of seeing the word STALL appear on your
            screen. You won't have this in an actual airplane, of
            course. You may, however, have a red stall warning
            light activate, which is almost the same thing.</p>

            <p>Now that you have a good foundation in stall
            aerodynamics, let's examine the details of stall
            recovery.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Stop Flying; Start Stalling</p>

            <p>Pulling way back on the joystick causes the wings to
            exceed their critical angle of attack and stall. During
            the stall, airflow burbles instead of flowing smoothly
            over the top of the wing. This results in insufficient
            lift for flight, causing the airplane to pitch forward
            (provided that the baggage, passengers, and fuel are
            loaded properly in the airplane). This automatic
            nose-down pitch is somewhat like doing the Heimlich
            maneuver on yourself; the airplane reduces its own
            angle of attack to less than the critical value and
            regains its ability to fly.</p>

            <p>If airplanes are built to recover from stalls
            themselves, why do you need to learn any of this? The
            problem is that pilots often do things that prevent
            stall recovery. You need to know what these things are.
            Also, an accidental stall close to the ground requires
            that you know how to quickly recover in order to
            minimize your altitude loss. Let's try another stall,
            but this time, let's see what happens if you prevent
            the airplane from pitching forward on its own.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Doing the Wrong Thing in a
            Stall</p>

            <p>What happens if we stall and prevent the airplane
            from recovering from the stall?</p>

            <p>The answer is that the airplane will remain stalled
            with the joystick held full aft (that's all the way
            back). It will not climb no matter how hard you pull on
            that joystick. Think about this carefully: You could
            remain stalled all the way to the ground while the
            joystick is pulled full aft, which doesn't bring you
            much joy, right? Holding the joystick full aft keeps
            the wing's angle of attack at or beyond its critical
            value. Unfortunately, this is what some pilots do after
            stalling an airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Doing the Right Thing in a
            Stall</p>

            <p>That's why we learned that you must release any back
            pressure on that joystick and move it forward until the
            wings are at less than their critical angle of attack.
            The proper attitude for recovery is subject to many
            variables, so in the Interactive Lessons, we'll use a
            5- to 10-degree nose-down pitch for simulator stall
            recoveries. You don't want an excessively steep
            nose-down attitude since it results in excessive
            altitude loss and airspeed increase.</p>

            <p>How do you know if you've decreased the angle of
            attack sufficiently? In a simulator, you should
            experience these things: the stall horn stops blaring,
            the word STALL disappears from the screen, the airplane
            begins to fly again, the airspeed begins to increase,
            and the flight controls become more responsive. If your
            instructor were on board, his or her voice would also
            reduce in pitch, and whales would no longer be inclined
            to beach themselves.</p>

            <p>With a few exceptions, this is the way pilots have
            always recognized stalls and recovered from them.
            You'll also want to add full power immediately after
            reducing the angle of attack. This helps accelerate the
            stall recovery process. Be careful not to let the nose
            pitch up as you add power. This might, once again,
            increase the angle of attack sufficiently to induce
            another stall. When the airplane is no longer stalled
            (that is, the stall horn stops blaring), raise the nose
            to climb attitude, and establish climb airspeed.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Departure Stalls</p>

            <p>What happens if you stall with full power already
            applied? Let's say that you've just lifted off from an
            airport and are climbing with full power (as you
            normally do in this airplane). Suddenly, you find a big
            bumblebee in the cockpit. You're distracted and forget
            to fly the airplane as you swat the critter with both
            hands. Of course, all your flailing in the air makes
            the cockpit look like the set of a kung fu movie as the
            airplane stalls. What do you do?</p>

            <p>Well, Grasshopper, all the kung fu in the world
            won't help you now unless you do one thing: Reduce the
            wing's angle of attack to less than its critical value.
            Once the airplane is no longer stalled, you can recover
            back to climbing attitude. Don't worry about touching
            the throttle, since full power is already applied.</p>

            <p>There you have it: your first introduction to the
            aerial theme park known as Stall World. The only
            problem, however, is that you didn't visit one corner
            of the park called Reality Land. Here's what you
            missed.</p>

            <p>It's easy to remember that airplanes stall because
            they exceed their critical angle of attack. But don't
            forget that this can happen in any attitude, at any
            airspeed, and at any power setting. Time now for more
            truth.</p>

            <p>In reality, if the airplane was pointed straight
            down and you pulled back hard enough on the controls,
            the airplane would stall. Of course, we wouldn't do
            this in the actual airplane (even if it was a rental).
            Remember, this is a simulator. We can do things you'd
            never dream of doing in a real airplane. It's like
            visiting Fantasy Land, in that we're not exposed to
            great risk in the demonstration. So we can take
            advantage of our technology and see what others only
            talk about and never actually do.</p>
