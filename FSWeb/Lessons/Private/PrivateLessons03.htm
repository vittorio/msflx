            <p>Have you ever been so lost in your car that you
            actually considered pulling into a used car lot,
            selling the car, and using the money to purchase a new
            identity? If so, you were really lost. Getting unlost
            is easy, especially in a car. You simply drive into a
            gas station and ask for directions. You can't do that
            in an airplane. It attracts way too much attention,
            even if you buy gas and check the oil. Fortunately, you
            don't need to worry about getting lost in an airplane
            if you know how to use a little navigational device
            known as a VOR, which stands for <strong>V</strong>ery high
            frequency <strong>O</strong>mnidirectional <strong>R</strong>ange.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">The Big Picture</p>

            <p>VOR navigation requires two things: airborne VOR
            equipment, like that shown in Figure 3-1, and a ground
            transmitting station, which, from an altitude of
            several thousand feet, looks like an itty-bitty house
            with an enormous bowling pin on the roof.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            </table>

            <p>The ground transmitter produces 360 electronic
            courses, each of which runs through the center of the
            station, as depicted in Figure 3-2.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">

            </table>

            <p>Each course is aligned with a specific degree on the
            compass, with 0 degrees pointing north, 90 degrees
            pointing east, 270 degrees pointing west, and so on.
            Using your airborne VOR equipment, you can navigate on
            any one of these 360 courses while going directly to or
            from a VOR station.</p>

            <p>Of course, navigating to or from a VOR station does
            no good unless you know where that station is.
            Fortunately, pilots always fly with aeronautical
            sectional charts (Figure 3-3), which depict the
            locations of VOR stations.</p>

            <p>The VOR station (position A) is located in the
            middle of the compass rose, which has small markings
            every 5 degrees, larger markings every 10 degrees, and
            numbers every 30 degrees.</p>

            <p>A box in the vicinity of the compass rose lists the
            name, Morse code identification, and frequency of the
            VOR ground station (position B). In Figure 3-3, the VOR
            frequency is <strong>112.3</strong>. Don't worry about the <strong>CH
            70</strong>. That's the frequency for military pilots and
            has nothing to do with cable TV.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Your VOR Equipment</p>

            <p>Most airplanes have one or more VOR receivers on
            board; each one is connected to a VOR display that
            looks similar to the one shown in Figure 3-4.</p>

            <p>When pilots refer to &quot;the VOR&quot; in their airplane,&quot;
            they are usually talking about the display, which
            consists of five main components:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>An index at the top of the display that points to
              the selected course.</li>

              <li>A vertical needle (also known as a course
              deviation indicator, or CDI) that swings right or
              left.</li>

              <li>A flag (or ambiguity indicator) in the form of a
              triangle that points up or down or a red-and-white
              striped flag. (A triangle pointing up represents a
              <strong>TO</strong> indication; a triangle pointing down
              represents a <strong>FROM</strong> indication, and a
              red-and-white striped flag represents an <strong>OFF</strong>
              indication. In this ground school session, I'll use
              the words <strong>TO</strong>, <strong>FROM</strong>, and <strong>OFF</strong> to
              represent these three flag indications.)</li>

              <li>An omnibearing selector (OBS). This is the knob
              you turn to select a course.</li>

              <li>A circular, moveable compass card, which is
              adjusted by rotating the OBS. (Rotating the OBS
              causes a different course value to move to the
              index.)</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">How to Navigate using VOR</p>

            <p>To navigate by VOR, you must first tune and identify
            the VOR station on which you want to navigate. With the
            appropriate frequency in the navigation receiver,
            you're ready to select a course to fly (a highway in
            the sky).</p>

            <p>Rotating the OBS and placing a specific number above
            the index (shown in Figure 3-5) allows you to select
            any one of the VOR station's 360 flyable courses.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson12Figure05.gif" alt="" border=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Let's suppose you select 360 degrees (or 0
            degrees&#8212;they're the same thing) using the OBS.
            Your VOR display now automatically orients itself to
            show you where the 360-degree course is located
            relative to your airplane. As you can see, the
            360-degree course runs completely through the VOR in a
            direction of 360 degrees. If you had selected the
            270-degree course, your VOR display would orient itself
            to the 270-degree course, as shown in Figure 3-5B.</p>

            <p>Selecting 030 degrees using the OBS orients the
            display to the course shown in Figure 3-5C. Selecting
            240 degrees orients the display to the course shown in
            Figure 3-5D.</p>

            <p>When operating Flight Simulator, be aware that the
            VOR's course selector knob rotates. Place your cursor
            near it, and when a plus sign (+) or minus sign (-)
            comes into view, select a specific course by clicking
            the mouse button.</p>

            <p>Let's say that you've selected the 360-degree course
            (360 is shown above the index). To fly this course,
            you'd turn to a direction of 360 degrees on the heading
            indicator. Assuming you've done this, the VOR indicator
            should show a centered needle with a <strong>TO</strong> flag
            (upward-pointing triangle) indication, as shown in
            Figure 3-6A.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>When you are directly over the station (Figure
            3-6B), the flag reads <strong>OFF</strong> (red and white
            stripes), indicating that you're neither going to nor
            from the VOR at the time. Simply stated, if the
            airplane is headed in the direction of the selected
            course and the needle is centered, the <strong>TO</strong> or
            <strong>FROM</strong> flag tells you if you're going to or from
            the VOR station.</p>

            <p>As you fly along the selected course, the <strong>TO</strong>
            flag automatically changes to a <strong>FROM</strong> flag
            (downward-pointing triangle) as you pass the VOR
            station (Figure 3-6C).</p>

            <p>So what happens if you are flying the correct
            heading and your VOR needle is not perfectly centered?
            That means you aren't yet aligned with the correct
            course. Figure 3-7 shows several airplanes and their
            respective VOR indications.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

            <p>Airplane A is heading 360 degrees (the direction of
            the selected course). Its VOR display shows a right
            needle with a <strong>TO</strong> indication. This means that the
            selected course is to the right, and, if Airplane A was
            on the course, it would be headed directly to the
            station. Airplane A must turn to the right to intercept
            the selected course. So must Airplanes C and E.
            Airplanes B, D, and F must turn left to intercept the
            course. Notice that when you are abeam of the station
            (90 degrees to the side of it), the flag shows
            <strong>OFF</strong>. No, this doesn't mean you're off course. It
            means that you are momentarily neither going to nor
            from the station. Remember, the needle leaning one
            direction or the other is telling you to turn that
            way.</p>

            Course</p>

            <p>Let's assume you want to depart Whatzitz Airport and
            fly the 030-degree course to and beyond the VOR, as
            shown in Figure 3-8.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

            <p>To be precise, degree values less than 100 are shown
            with a 0 in front of them. This prevents pilots from
            thinking that a value of 30 is 300 degrees. We
            pronounce 030 as &quot;zero-three-zero.&quot; Say it like this,
            and you'll sound like an experienced airline
            captain.</p>

            <p>Your destination is Yazoo Airport, which lies on the
            030-degree course from the Rodster VOR. With your OBS
            set to 030, you depart Whatzitz. The VOR display shows
            a left needle with a <strong>TO</strong> indication. A right or
            left needle indication doesn't tell you on which side
            of the selected course the airplane is located. To
            determine this, you must physically point the airplane
            in the direction of the selected course (or at least
            imagine yourself pointed in this direction). Why? The
            VOR needle and flag indications are completely
            independent of the airplane's heading.</p>

            <p>I can't emphasize this point enough: VORs don't know
            which way your airplane is heading. That's because the
            airborne VOR display is programmed to think of itself
            as always pointing in the direction of the selected
            course. The display only knows if it's to the right or
            left of the selected course and whether that course
            will take it to or from the station.</p>

            <p>Obviously, the 030-degree course is not to the left
            of the airplane. But if you turn the airplane to the
            direction of the selected course (030 degrees), then
            the needle and the flag properly orient you to that.
            Now, and only now, can the needle be said to tell you
            that the selected course is physically to the left of
            the airplane. The <strong>TO/FROM</strong> flag tells you that
            once you're on the course and heading in a direction of
            030 degrees, you'll be going directly to the VOR
            station (we'll assume there's no wind to blow you off
            course in this example).</p>

            <p>I know there's a question burning in your mind: If
            you must turn to the left to intercept the 030-degree
            course, how many degrees to the left should you turn?
            The answer is more than 0 degrees and less than 90
            degrees. It all depends on how fast you want to
            intercept. For practical purposes, if the VOR needle is
            fully deflected, you won't necessarily know if the
            selected course is 1 mile away or 100 miles away. In
            these situations, your objective should be to get on
            the course as quickly as possible; therefore, intercept
            at a 90-degree angle. Ask yourself, what heading is 90
            degrees to the left of 030 degrees? Just look at the
            compass and count 90 degrees to the left of the
            selected course (Figure 3-9).</p>

            <p>Flying a heading of 300 degrees (this is
            perpendicular to the selected course) allows you to
            intercept in the shortest time.</p>

            <p>Looking back at Figure 3-8, Airplane B must turn to
            the left to intercept the 030-degree course. How many
            degrees to the left should it turn? The answer is more
            than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees. If we wanted
            to intercept the course in the shortest possible time,
            we'd turn to a heading of 300 degrees (this is a
            perpendicular heading to the selected course), as shown
            by Airplane C in Figure 3-8.</p>

            <p>Don't worry if you can't do this precisely at first.
            How quickly the needle centers depends on how close you
            are to the station. A little bit of experience will
            teach you to estimate the rate at which the needle
            approaches the center and how soon to begin your turn
            on the course heading.</p>

            <p>Let's make VOR usage even more practical. Suppose
            you are airborne in the vicinity of Ulost Airport
            (Airplane A in Figure 3-10) and want to fly to Wrongway
            Airport.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson12Figure10.gif" alt="" border=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Since this is a VOR lesson, let's use the VOR to
            find Wrongway. Ask yourself, &quot;What's the best way to
            get to the Bigfoot VOR?&quot; It's reasonable to assume
            you're always on some course that goes to a VOR. But
            how do you know which course this is? Here's how.</p>

            <p>Tune in the Bigfoot VOR frequency on your
            navigational radio, and rotate the OBS until you get a
            TO flag indication with a centered needle, as shown by
            Airplane B in Figure 3-10. Look up at the index to see
            what course is selected. In this instance, you're on
            the 305-degree course to the Bigfoot VOR. Turn to a
            heading of 305 degrees on your heading indicator, and
            fly that course to the VOR, as shown by Airplane B.
            Easy, eh?</p>

            <p>As you approach the VOR, ask yourself what course
            runs from the center of the station through Wrongway
            Airport. Draw a line (or eyeball the value) to
            determine this course. It appears that the 255-degree
            course runs from the VOR through Wrongway Airport.
            Therefore, when you're over the station, turn the
            airplane in a direction of 255 degrees, then rotate the
            OBS to 255 degrees. Now your VOR display is set to
            track the 255-degree course from the airport to
            Wrongway Airport, as shown by Airplane C.</p>

            <p class="LessonSubHead2">Wind Correction while Tracking a VOR
            Course</p>

            <p>I hope you aren't blown away by all this. But then
            again, how could you be blown away since I haven't
            talked about wind? Until now, I've assumed a wind-free
            environment, but this seldom exists in the real world.
            Let's learn how to correct for wind when navigating
            using VOR.</p>

            <p>Wind correction is broken down into three
            components:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Identifying the effect of wind on the
              airplane</li>

              <li>Reintercepting the course</li>

              <li>Applying a wind correction</li>
            </ul>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/Lesson12Figure11.gif" alt="" border=
                "0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Figure 3-11</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Here's how this works:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Identify the effect of wind. Airplane A in Figure
              3-11 has just intercepted the 030-degree course to
              the VOR. Under a no-wind condition, Airplane A could
              hold a 030-degree heading and fly to the VOR with a
              centered needle. With a little wind, however,
              Airplane A is sure to drift off course. Determining
              wind direction and making the proper correction is
              the first step to successful navigation.</li>

              <li>To determine the effect of wind on the airplane,
              head the airplane in the direction of the selected
              course (030 degrees in this example). Now you must
              wait a bit. If there is no wind, the needle should
              stay centered (or nearly so). If a crosswind exists,
              the needle will eventually show a deflection, as
              depicted by Airplane B. How much of a needle
              deflection should you allow before reintercepting the
              course? Perhaps the best advice in this instance is
              to let the needle move just a little (perhaps less
              than one dot on the VOR's display), and then make a
              correction.</li>

              <li>Reintercept the course. If the needle moves to
              the left, then the selected course is to the left, as
              shown by Airplane B. The airplane was blown to the
              right of the course (implying the crosswind is from
              your left). Once you've identified the wind
              direction, you need to get back on course before
              applying a wind correction. You can get back on
              course by intercepting at a 20-degree angle, as shown
              by Airplane C in Figure 3-11 (strong winds sometimes
              require that you reintercept at a 30- to 40-degree
              angle).</li>

              <li>Apply a wind correction. Once reestablished on
              course, the third step is to apply a wind correction.
              You must compensate for the wind's push by heading
              the airplane into the wind. How much? That depends on
              several variables, one of which is the wind's speed
              and direction. Actually, these variables don't really
              matter all that much. Just start with a 10-degree
              wind correction angle and see what happens. It's just
              like going to the movies. You never quite know how
              good or bad the film might be, so you try it
              (although the last movie I watched was so bad that I
              walked out. Unfortunately, it was on TV at the time,
              and I walked out of my own house). Once you're on
              course, turn the airplane so it's pointed 10 degrees
              into the wind (which means it's now heading 020
              degrees, as shown by Airplane D in Figure 3-11). Be
              patient. Wait to see what happens.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>As you can see, Airplane E is tracking directly to
            the VOR station on the 030-degree course. The needle
            hasn't moved. And you're darn lucky if you&#8212;or,
            for that matter, any experienced pilot&#8212;can find
            the proper wind-correction angle on the first attempt.
            Realistically, you'll probably need to make a minimum
            of two attempts at determining a wind-correction angle
            before finding the proper value. The same
            wind-correction principle applies when tracking from
            the VOR on a specific course.</p>

            <p>You're on your way to becoming a high priest of VOR
            tracking, master of all meteorological forces, and
            reigning monarch of all airway navigation. You'll be
            required to walk around the airport in white robes.
            Pilots from all over will come seeking your guidance.
            Wow, TV shows! Live appearances! Think of the
            possibilities. At the very least, you'll get to your
            destination with ease.</p>

                  <p class="SubHead2">Advanced Learning for VOR
                  Navigation: VORs and Airborne Freeways</p>

                  <p>Until now I've referred to all VOR routes as
                  courses and for good reason, too. It makes the
                  whole process easier to understand. In order to
                  do advanced things, such as fly instrument
                  approaches, you need to think about tracking to
                  and from a VOR on a specific radial instead of a
                  specific course. While pilots speak of traveling
                  to and from a VOR on a specific course, they can
                  also speak of traveling to and from the VOR on
                  any one of its 360-degree radials.</p>

                  <p>Let's begin our discussion with a recollection
                  of your last car trip when you drove through a
                  small town. Let's also say the freeway pointed
                  due north as it passed straight through this
                  town, as shown in Figure 3-12A. While entering
                  and leaving the town, your car pointed north (360
                  degrees), in the same direction as the freeway.
                  If the portion of the freeway exiting this town
                  had a different name than the portion entering
                  the town, would this affect the direction your
                  car pointed while passing through town? Of course
                  not. So let's call the portion of the freeway
                  exiting the town to the south Freeway 180 and the
                  portion exiting to the north Freeway 360, as
                  shown in Figure 3-12B Now we can say that we went
                  to town on Freeway 180 and exited on Freeway 360.
                  Your direction never changed despite giving the
                  freeway different names.</p>

                  <p>Navigation by VOR is basically the same, as
                  shown by Figure 3-12C. If you're headed
                  northbound to the Town VOR, you travel inbound on
                  the 180-degree radial and outbound on the
                  360-degree radial. Either way, your airborne
                  freeway points in a direction of 360 degrees,
                  just like the ground-bound freeway. Referring to
                  a single freeway by radials going to and from a
                  VOR station is sometimes awkward. But this is the
                  way instrument pilots are required to think of
                  VOR navigation. Therefore, when you're asked to
                  intercept and track to a VOR station on the 180
                  radial, you must think of setting your OBS to 360
                  degrees (or the 180-degree reciprocal of the
                  radial on which you'll track to the station).
                  Until you start to fly instrument approaches,
                  just think of all VOR routes as courses.</p>
