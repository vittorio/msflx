            Private Pilot Certificate

            <p>The first step after completing your Student lessons
            is to earn your Flight Simulator Private Pilot
            certificate. The Flight Simulator Private Pilot
            training extends your foundation of fundamental
            piloting skills. You'll fly a Cessna 172 and learn
            basic flight maneuvers and radio navigation. Mastering
            these skills will help you progress more smoothly
            through the rest of your training.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 1: Stalls</p>

            <p>Flying an airplane slowly is required to land, so
            learning about stall&#8212;when a wing stops developing
            enough lift&#8212;is among the most important skills
            you'll need.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 2: Steep turns</p>

            <p>Become proficient at steep turns&#8212;you'll learn
            to fly more precisely and to divide your attention
            between the instruments and the view outside; in this
            case, a view of the Olympic Mountains.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 3: VOR navigation</p>

            <p>Learn about a basic form of radio navigation using a
            VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) at Paine Field (KPAE)
            in Everett, Washington. This radio navigation aid will
            help you find your way to many places in the world.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 4: The traffic pattern</p>

            <p>Learn to fly a standard traffic pattern around
            Bremerton national airport.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lesson 5: Air traffic control</p>

            <p>Navigating your way through complex airspace and
            crowded skies requires talking to Air Traffic Control
            (ATC). This lesson will help you learn the Flight
            Simulator ATC system.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Solo flights</p>

            <p>Practicing how to taxi, steep turns, and flying in
            the traffic pattern will go a long way to helping you
            convince the examiner that you deserve a Flight
            Simulator Private Pilot certificate.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Private Pilot checkride</p>

            <p>Taking the big step from student pilot to Flight
            Simulator Private Pilot requires you to demonstrate all
            the skills needed to take off, climb, level off, turn,
            navigate, descend, and land safely. It's a lot to
            learn, but the rewards are worth it. It's time to put
            it all together for the examiner. Meet high standards,
            and you'll be awarded a Flight Simulator Private Pilot
            Certificate.</p>
