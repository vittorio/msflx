          <p>In the world of aviation, the pinnacle of airplane
          flying is piloting a jet. With their size, speed, and
          increased complexity, jets offer a challenge unknown to
          the piston-engine pilot. For Flight Simulator pilots,
          flying jets is a chance to see what airline and corporate
          pilots do on the job.</p>

          <p>Things happen quickly in a jet, so there's a new set
          of skills required. Learning it all is part of the fun.
          You can learn all of the skills required to fly Flight
          Simulator jets in the Airline Transport Pilot (ATP)
          section of the <strong>Lessons</strong> with Rod
          Machado. (Click <strong>Learning Center</strong> and then click the

          <p>All of what you've learned flying smaller airplanes
          will be useful as you learn to fly a jet, but you'll also
          be introduced to new terminology and technology. Some
          instruments will look different, and there will be a few
          new controls.</p>

          <p class="SubHead2">Glass Cockpits</p>

          <p>Look at the instrument panel of one of the Flight
          Simulator jets, and you'll notice it looks different than
          the panel of a Cessna. Instead of many small round
          mechanical instruments, there are a few large computer
          screens. And although the information is virtually the
          same as what you see on the panel of a smaller piston
          aircraft, the presentation is different: airspeed and
          altitude may be presented on "tapes" that run vertically
          down the left and right sides of the main display. You'll
          also see a navigation display that looks quite similar to
          the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) found in many
          high-end light aircraft. Along the top of the instrument
          panel you'll see the mode control panel (MCP), which
          includes the controls for the autopilot and
          autothrottles. And there are many engine gauges that
          provide the crew with lots of information about what's
          happening in each part of each engine.</p>

          <p>An autothrottle works in association with the
          autopilot to maintain a set speed; a computer controls
          the throttles, so you don't have to. To learn more about
          flying using an autothrottle, see <a href=

          <p>Jets are heavy, and they move quickly. You'll learn
          how to use the aircraft's momentum to manage your speed
          and altitude so as not to exceed limits, and so you can

          be.</p><a name="spoilers" id="spoilers"></a>

          <p class="SubHead2">Spoilers</p>

          <p>Need to slow down or descend in a hurry? Spoilers are
          flaps that extend upward and disrupt (spoil) the airflow
          over the wing, resulting in increased drag. You'll also
          use the spoilers during landing, to increase drag and
          slow down. If you arm the spoilers, they'll automatically
          deploy upon touchdown.</p>

          <p>Once a jet lands, it needs to slow down quickly. In
          addition to raising the spoilers, you can engage the
          thrust reversers, which direct air forward out of the jet
          engines. You'll hear a satisfying roar, and the aircraft
          will lose speed rapidly. You should never engage the
          thrust reversers until the wheels touch the runway.</p>

          <p class="SubHead2">Autobrakes</p>

          <p>Many jets (including all of the Boeing jets in Flight
          Simulator) are equipped with autobrakes that make braking
          upon landing an easy task. Set the autobrakes to
          <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, or
          <strong>3</strong> before your final approach, and the
          airplane will smoothly stop itself upon touchdown; the
          higher the number, the more rapid the deceleration. A
          setting of 1 or 2 is typical. Max is used only in
          emergencies. The autobrakes can also be set to
          <strong>RTO</strong> (Rejected Takeoff) for takeoff. If
          the airspeed rises above 80 knots and the throttles go to
          idle (if you abort the takeoff), maximum braking will
          automatically be applied.</p>

          <p>Jets parked at a gate must be "pushed back" before
          they can taxi to the runway. In the real world, this task
          is accomplished by a "tug," a small tractor designed for
          the job. When you're parked at a gate in Flight
          Simulator, you'll need to have your aircraft pushed back

          <p class="SubHead">The Simplified Way: Just Go For It</p>

          <p>There are two ways to fly jets in Flight Simulator:
          the realistic way, and the simplified way. If you want to
          learn to fly jets realistically, read the next section,
          then take the ATP training in the <strong>Lessons</strong>. 
		  But if you just want to take a jet up
          and see what it's all about, here's all you need to know
          to get started.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Line up on the centerline of a long
                  runway.</li>

                  <li>Extend the flaps down two or three notches:
                  Press <strong>F7</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Release the brakes: Press
                  <strong>PERIOD</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Apply full power: Move your joystick's
                  throttle control or press
                  <strong>F4</strong>.</li>

                  <li>At 150 to 160 knots, pitch up smoothly to 20
                  degrees nose up.</li>

                  <li>Raise the landing gear: Press
                  <strong>G</strong>.</li>

                  <li>At 1,000 feet AGL, pitch down to 10 degrees
                  nose up, and reduce power with your your
                  joystick's throttle control or by pressing
                  <strong>F2</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Retract the flaps: Press
                  <strong>F6</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Climb to cruising altitude.</li>

                  <li>Power back to idle to initiate the
                  descent.</li>

                  <li>Approximately 15 miles from the airport,
                  reduce your speed to 180 knots by adding some
                  flaps (press <strong>F7</strong>) and using the
                  spoilers if necessary: Press <strong>/ (FORWARD
                  SLASH)</strong>.</li>

                  <li>As you begin the approach at approximately
                  2,000 feet AGL, make sure the spoilers are down,
                  start reducing speed to 150 knots, lower the
                  landing gear, and add the rest of the flaps:
                  Press <strong>G</strong> and
                  <strong>F7</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Arm the spoilers and set the autobrakes:
                  Press <strong>SHIFT+/ (FORWARD SLASH)</strong>,
                  and click the autobrake knob to the desired
                  setting.</li>

                  <li>Maintain 140 to 160 knots during the approach
                  (the more fuel, the faster), and a 500 fpm
                  descent rate. Keep the runway numbers in the
                  center of the windscreen.</li>

                  <li>As you cross the runway threshold at 50 feet,
                  reduce power to idle, and flare slowly: Press
                  <strong>F1</strong>.</li>

                  <li>As the main wheels touch first, slowly let
                  the nose come down. The spoilers will deploy and
                  the autobrakes will start slowing the
                  aircraft.</li>

                  <li>Engage the thrust reversers: Press
                  <strong>F2</strong>.</li>

                  <li>At 60 knots, disengage the thrust reversers:
                  Press <strong>F1</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Taxi to parking.</li>

          <p>Real-world airline pilots are required to hold an
          Airline Transport Pilot certificate, considered the PhD
          of flying. In Flight Simulator, you have two choices for
		  transitioning to jets:</p>
