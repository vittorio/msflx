            <p>The <strong>Free Flight</strong> dialog box
            allows you to easily configure a flight scenario of your own,
            specifying the aircraft, location, weather, and time
            and season. The <strong>Load Flight</strong> dialog box

            <p>Technically speaking, a flight in Flight Simulator
            is &quot;a saved situation.&quot; Once saved, you can load it
            again and again, starting with exactly the same
            situation each time without having to set things up
            manually. Saved parameters include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Aircraft</li>

              <li>Aircraft position</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Flights can start on the ground, at an airport, or in

			<p class="SubHead2">A Note for Advanced Users</p>

            <p>A flight (.flt) file contains hundreds of
            parameters; some are easy to understand, some are
            complex. If you save a flight, then realize that you
            want to make a change (for example you saved the flight
            with the landing light on, but you want it off), you
            have two choices:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Load the flight, make the change, then resave the
              flight.</li>
			</ul>
			-or-
              <ul>
			  	<li>Open the .flt file with a text editor such as
              Notepad. Search through the text (which is organized
              into logical sections) until you find the relevant
              line (for example, <strong>LandingLights=True</strong>) and
			  change it to the value you want (in this case False).</li>

            <p>It's easy to share flights with other users. Just
            send all of the files associated with the flight
            (<strong>.flt</strong>, <strong>.wx</strong>, <strong>.pln</strong>, and <strong>.htm</strong>
            files) from your <strong>My Documents\Flight Simulator X
            Files</strong> folder. Your friends can then put the files
            in their own <strong>My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files</strong>
            folder, and your flights will appear in their <strong>Load Flight</strong>

            <p class="SubHead">Frequently Asked Questions</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How can I use flights to help me
            practice my skills?</p>

            <p>You can create flights to practice particular flying or navigating
            skills. Then instead of choosing an aircraft, setting your
            location, taking off, and flying all the way to that
            point, you can simply select one of your saved flights.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">I run a virtual airline. How can I
            use flights and categories?</p>

            <p>Instead of publishing pilot schedules, you can
            create flights for your routes. <em>Flight
            213</em> for example, would begin at the gate with the
            flight plan already loaded and the weather defined
            (or the pilot can use <strong>Real-world weather</strong>).</p>

                  <p>There are dozens of virtual airlines on the
                  Web. Once on board, you'll download the airline's
                  aircraft, scenery, and training materials, and
                  then use Flight Simulator to complete assigned
                  flights. You'll send reports of your flights back
                  to the airline and work your way through

            <p class="SubHead2">How can I use weather to enhance
            the flights I make?</p>

            <p>Not only does weather affect what a pilot does, it
            affects what a pilot sees. Use cloud layers,
            visibility, and precipitation to set the scene.
            Changing the weather is also an easy way to turn a simple flight
            into a challenging one. It's fun to become familiar with a
            route in good weather, and then try the same flight in
            different conditions. You could create a category that
            contains multiple versions of the same flight, but with
            different weather conditions. For more information on
            weather, see <a href=
            "../TheWorld/WeatherIntro.htm">Introduction to Flight
            Simulator Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Can I make multi-leg flights with
            landings at more than one airport?</p>

            <p>Yes and no. VFR flights can have multiple legs, but
            remember that flights are just starting situations.
            What the pilot does after loading the flight is up to
            him or her. For multi-leg or round-trip VFR flights, you
            can create one flight rather than creating a
            flight for each leg.</p>

            <p>For IFR flights that use the Air Traffic Control
            feature, each leg of a multi-leg flight needs its own
            flight plan, and thus must be a separate flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Do I need to include flight plans
            with my flights?</p>

            <p>Yes and no. Just as in the real world, you need a
            flight plan to fly under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
            Flight Simulator's Air Traffic Control feature won't
            recognize IFR flights without a flight plan. Use the Flight
            Planner to create the flight plan, then load it, set
            weather and other parameters, and save the flight.</p>

            <p>VFR flights don't require a flight plan. In fact,
            some VFR Flight Simulator flights are more challenging 
			without a flight plan.
            Pilots have to rely on using pilotage and dead
            reckoning.</p>

            <p>Note that the Navigation Log and GPS in Flight
            Simulator use flight plans. If a flight doesn't have an
            associated flight plan, the Navigation Log on the
            Kneeboard will be blank, and the GPS won't have the
            flight plan loaded or display a course line. If you
            want to provide this information, include a flight
            plan along with your flight.</p>
