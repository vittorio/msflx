            <p>As a Multiplayer session host, there are a number of 
			options you can set to determine
			what other players are allowed to do in your session.</p> 
			
			<p>When a player is changing aircraft, location, and other settings 
			during a Multiplayer session, the session continues. That means that
			everyone else is probably flying away from that player while they're
			changing settings.</p>
			
			<p>That might be fine when the intent of your session is not to
			stay together. For example, if all the players are practicing landings
			at a particular airport, no one is going to get lost from your group of
			players while changing aircraft or settings. Or if you're acting as 
			a Multiplayer <a href="MultiplayerATC.htm">air 
			traffic controller</a>, you likely don't care where anyone is in 
			the sky when you're not controlling them.</p>
			
			<p>Under these conditions, you
			probably want to give players as much freedom to change settings as 
			possible.</p>
			
			<p>If, however, you are flying with new pilots, flight instructing,
			racing, or formation flying, you might want to restrict players' freedom
			to make changes in the session to prevent players from getting lost.</p>
			
			<p>See the tables below for an explanation of the various advanced
			options.</p>
