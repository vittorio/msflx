            <p>An exciting feature of Flight Simulator is the ability
			to have realistic communications between pilots and air
			traffic control during flights. As a Multiplayer participant
			you can act as an air traffic controller for other Flight 
			Simulator pilots or interact with ATC as a pilot yourself.</p>
			
			<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Multiplayer Tower is only available in Flight
			Simulator Deluxe version.</p>
			
			<p>If you're new to this, you can learn from other virtual 
			pilots and controllers online using	Flight Simulator Multiplayer.
			You can also read more introductory material in the 
			Learning Center's <strong>Air Traffic Control</strong> section.
			That material generally refers to the artificially intelligent
			air traffic control in Flight Simulator. For an overview of real ATC,
			see <a href="../airtrafficcontrol/ATCDefined.htm">Air Traffic
			Control Defined</a>.</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/MPATC01.jpg" 
				alt="" border="0" width="320" height="239"></p>

				<p class="SubHead">Control Tower (Deluxe only)</p>
				
            <p>Setting up a control tower in Flight Simulator is easy.
			Whether you're hosting a Multiplayer session or joining someone
			else's session, you can choose to be a pilot or
			a tower controller. And you can choose among thousands of real-world 
			airport control towers.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> To learn how to use the tower controller screens,
			see <a href="MultiplayerUsingATCPanels.htm">Acting as a Tower Controller</a>.
			
			<p>Your view as a tower controller is from the inside of the control
			tower cab. You can move to different stations in the tower, and display
			various parts of the controller screens as you need them.</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/MPATC02.jpg" 
				alt="" border="0" width="320" height="246"></p>
				
			<p>You'll direct traffic for the other pilots flying in and out of
			your airport. You can 
			<a href="MultiplayerHostingAMultiplayerSession.htm#VoiceCommunication">
			communicate with them by voice</a> (or text chat) so it helps
			 to gain some proficiency with air traffic control procedures
			and language if you want your tower to be realistic.</p>
			
			<p>Your Flight Simulator tower can be as real or as fun as you 
			want it to be.</p>
			
			<p class="SubHead2">ATC realism</p>
			
			<p>You'll find that there are some very serious virtual pilots on
			the Internet who want their air traffic control to be as real as possible.
			There are also virtual air traffic controllers who are air traffic 
			controllers in real life! If you're acting as a controller 
			in Multiplayer and want to direct real pilots or really dedicated 
			virtual pilots, you may	want to look for a Multiplayer session 
			where the pilots intend to use real-world terminology and procedures.</p>

            <p>Whether you're a non-pilot newbie who just wants to interact
			with other players and ignore the rules, or a real-world pilot or
			serious virtual pilot who wants high realism, Flight Simulator's
			Multiplayer air traffic control is your ticket to fun.</p>

			<p>Realistic air traffic control has been one of the most consistently
			requested features in Flight Simulator for years. We've simulated
			<a href="../airtrafficcontrol/atcindex.htm">artificially intelligent 
			air traffic control</a> in previous versions, and that feature is very
			real and extremely popular. But there's nothing like having a live 
			controller on the other	side of the microphone to make the sweat 
			start beading on your forehead.</p>
			
			<p>There are all kinds of virtual pilots. Some are real pilots,
			including many airline pilots. If you
			want more realism in your interaction as a pilot with air traffic 
			control, <a href="MultiplayerJoiningAMultiplayerSession.htm">join a
			Multiplayer session</a> where participants intend to
			use real-world terminology and procedures.</p>
			
			<p>Some pilots will tell you that one of the hardest parts of learning
			to fly in the real world is learning to talk to air traffic control. 
			Flight Simulator's Multiplayer air traffic control is great for 
			student pilots or aspiring pilots. Real air traffic control interaction
			can be intimidating to a new pilot, and Flight Simulator allows you
			to learn and make mistakes all in the comfort and safety
			 of your home or office.</p>

            <p>Using a headset for voice communications in Multiplayer air traffic
			control adds realism. Your hands are free to 
			fly the aircraft or to push buttons if you're the air traffic controller.</p>
