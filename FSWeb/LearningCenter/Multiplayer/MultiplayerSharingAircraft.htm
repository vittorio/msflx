            <p>What if there was a way to get flight instruction over the Internet or
			a LAN? What if a friend on the other side of the world could take you
			for a flight over their favorite spot in Kathmandu? How about acting as
			a crew member on one of Flight Simulator's airliners?</p>
			
			<p>That's all possible using Flight Simulator's shared skies feature.</p>
			
			<p>Flight Simulator Multiplayer allows you to share
			control of a single aircraft. This is a great tool for giving or
			receiving instruction over the Internet or a LAN with
			someone far away (or down the hall).</p>

		<p>Sharing the aircraft can also be a fun way to have a friend
		show you some beautiful scenery without you ever having to travel to 
		their part of the world.</p>
				
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a participant in a Multiplayer 
			session, you either
			<a href="MultiplayerHostingAMultiplayerSession.htm">host a 
			session</a> or <a href="MultiplayerJoiningAMultiplayerSession.htm">
			join someone else's session</a>. The host must enable the sharing 
			option on the <a href="MultiplayerAdvHostOptions.htm">Advanced 
			Options</A> screen to allow other participants to share with players
			other than the host.</p><a name="Sharing"></a><br>
			
			<p class="SubHead">How to Share an Aircraft</p>
			
			<p>The essential thing to know about sharing aircraft is 
			that you can pass control of the aircraft back and forth
			between two participants in a Multiplayer session. An instructor
			can demonstrate a maneuver, then hand control to a student to
			have them try the same maneuver. Or you can take turns showing
			each other scenery in your part of the world.</p>
			
			<p><img src="images/MPSharingAircraft02.jpg" 
				alt="" border="0" width="320" height="231"></p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The host can share his aircraft at any time
			but the host cannot join another player's shared aircraft. The host
			must enable other players to share aircraft with each other.</p>
