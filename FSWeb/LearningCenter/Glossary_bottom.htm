          <p><strong>abeam</strong><br>
          A relative location approximately at right angles to the
          longitudinal axis of the aircraft. An object beside an
          aircraft is said to be abeam of it.</p><a name=
          "accelerated stall"></a>

          <p><strong>accelerated stall</strong><br>
          A stall induced by turns, pull-ups, or other maneuvers
          that increase the load factor (G-load) on an airplane.
          The loads imposed by such maneuvers typically increase
          the speed at which a wing stalls, but they do not affect
          the angle of attack at which the stall occurs. That
          angle, the critical angle of attack, is always the
          same.</p><a name="ace"></a>

          <p><strong>ace</strong><br>
          A military pilot who has destroyed at least five enemy
          aircraft. The term originated in France during World War
          I, where it was given only to top pilots who had downed
          at least 10 aircraft. Later, &quot;ace&quot; was commonly used for
          any pilot who claimed at least five aircraft. German aces
          in World War I were called Kanone
          (&quot;cannons&quot;).</p><a name="active runway"></a>

          <p><strong>active runway</strong><br>
          The runway currently in use for takeoffs and landings.
          Many large airports have more than one runway, usually
          arranged in a pattern to take advantage of prevailing
          winds. Some airports have parallel runways to accommodate
          more takeoffs and landings. Under specific conditions at
          airports with operating air traffic control towers,
          aircraft may also use intersecting runways for takeoffs
          and landings to expedite the traffic flow.</p><a name=
          "advection"></a>

          <p><strong>advection</strong><br>
          The horizontal movement of air or atmospheric properties.
          In meteorology, this process is sometimes referred to as
          the horizontal component of convection.</p><a name=
          "advection fog"></a>

          <p><strong>advection fog</strong><br>
          Fog resulting from the movement of warm, humid air over
          cooler ground or water. Advection fog is most common
          along coastal areas, although it often develops deep in
          continental areas. At sea, it is called &quot;sea fog.&quot;
          Advection fog deepens as wind speed increases up to about
          15 knots. Stronger winds lift the fog into a layer of low
          stratus or stratocumulus clouds.</p><a name=
          "advisory circulars"></a>

          <p><strong>advisory circulars (ACs)</strong><br>
          In the United States, nonregulatory information and
          procedures published by the FAA. Advisory circulars
          provide background information and more detail on
          subjects not completely outlined in the FARs or AIM.
          Advisory circulars are published by the Government
          Printing Office; many publishers also reprint important
          ACs as references for pilots. ACs are arranged in series,
          designated by a two- or three-digit number. Those in
          series 00 cover general subjects. ACs in the 10 series
          deal with procedural rules. ACs in the 20 series deal
          with aircraft; those in the 60 series cover pilots. ACs
          in the 70s series deal with airspace, while 90-series ACs
          cover air traffic and general operating rules. Issues
          related to air carriers (airlines) are covered in
          120-series ACs.</p><a name="aerobatics"></a>

          <p><strong>aerobatics</strong><br>
          Precision maneuvers, such as barrel rolls, loops,
          hammerhead stalls, spins, and Cuban eights. Often
          performed at airshows and competitions, many of these
          maneuvers are also part of a military pilot's training
          and can be used in aerial combat. In fact, many basic
          aerobatic maneuvers evolved from air-combat tactics
          invented during World War I.<br>
          &quot;Aerobatics&quot; is also defined in FAR 91.303, which
          describes restrictions on aerobatic flight. In that
          section, &quot;aerobatic flight&quot; means &quot;any intentional
          maneuver involving an abrupt change in an aircraft's
          attitude, an abnormal attitude, or abnormal acceleration,
          not necessary for normal flight.&quot;</p><a name=
          "aerodrome forecast"></a>

          <p><strong>aerodrome forecast (TAF)</strong><br>
          A concise statement of the expected meteorological
          conditions at an airport during a specified period
          (usually 24 hours). TAFs use the same codes employed in
          METAR weather reports. TAFs are scheduled four times
          daily for 24-hour periods, beginning at 0000Z, 0600Z,
          1200Z, and 1800Z. They contain the following information:
          type of report, location, issuance time, valid time, and
          forecast.</p><a name="aerodynamics"></a>

          <p><strong>aerodynamics</strong><br>
          The study of air in motion, in particular, the
          interactions between air and surfaces, such as an
          aircraft wing. Aerodynamicists--scientists and engineers
          who specialize in aerodynamics--use wind tunnels,
          computer models, and other tools to design and build
          aircraft and airfoils.</p><a name="aeronaut"></a>

          <p><strong>aeronaut</strong><br>
          The pilot or navigator of an airship or balloon. Famous
          aeronauts include the Montgolfier brothers, inventors of
          the hot-air balloon; Henri Giffard, builder and pilot of
          the first powered dirigible; and August Piccard, who rode
          a balloon into the stratosphere.</p><a name=
          "Aeronautical Information Manual"></a>

          <p><strong>Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)</strong><br>
          An official source of information about navigational
          aids, airport operations, air traffic control procedures,
          and other subjects of importance to pilots and air
          traffic controllers. Published by the FAA, the AIM is
          available from many publishers in printed and electronic
          formats.</p><a name="aeronautical sectional chart"></a>

          <p><strong>aeronautical sectional chart</strong><br>
          A 1:500,000-scale aeronautical map that includes
          topographical and navigational information for pilots to
          use during VFR flight.</p><a name="aeronautics"></a>

          <p><strong>aeronautics</strong><br>
          The study or science of flight.</p><a name=
          "aerospace"></a>

          <p><strong>aerospace</strong><br>
          The study of the science and technology of travel in the
          space above the earth. Aerospace includes travel within
          the atmosphere as well as in space beyond the
          earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p><a name=
          "A&#233;rospatiale"></a>

          <p><strong>A&#233;rospatiale</strong><br>
          French state-controlled aircraft-manufacturing company
          formed by the merger of Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation.
          Based in Toulouse, A&#233;rospatiale has produced a wide
          range of helicopters and was the manufacturer of the
          supersonic Concorde airliner.</p><a name="aerostat"></a>

          <p><strong>aerostat</strong><br>
          A lighter-than-air craft, such as a hot-air balloon or
          dirigible, that gets lift principally from buoyancy
          instead of generating lift with airfoils.</p><a name=
          "afterburner"></a>

          <p><strong>afterburner</strong><br>
          Device that injects fuel into the exhaust stream of a
          turbojet engine. The combustion of the unburned oxygen
          from the exhaust and the jet fuel provides an extra boost
          at takeoff or during combat maneuvers. Also known as
          &quot;reheat,&quot; especially in Great Britain.</p><a name=
          "AGL"></a>

          <p><strong>AGL</strong><br>
          Abbreviation for &quot;above ground level.&quot; The height of
          clouds in airport weather observations and forecasts is
          usually reported in AGL.</p><a name="ailerons"></a>

          <p><strong>ailerons</strong><br>
          Movable control surfaces, usually located near the wing
          tips, that control the rolling motion of an aircraft. The
          pilot deflects the ailerons by moving the control yoke or
          stick left and right. The ailerons move simultaneously in
          opposite directions. For example, when the pilot moves
          the yoke or stick left, the aileron on the left wing
          moves up, decreasing the lift on the left wing. At the
          same time, the right aileron moves down, increasing the
          lift on the right wing. The word derives from the French
          word aile, meaning &quot;wing.&quot;</p><a name="air mass"></a>

          <p><strong>air mass</strong><br>
          In meteorology, an extensive body of air within which the
          conditions of temperature and moisture in a horizontal
          plane are essentially uniform.</p><a name=
          "air traffic control"></a>

          <p><strong>air traffic control (ATC)</strong><br>
          A network of control towers, approach and departure
          controls, and Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs)
          designed to ensure the safe and efficient flow of air
          traffic. ATC's primary responsibility is to maintain
          separation between aircraft operating under Instrument
          Flight Rules (IFR), but ATC also provides services to
          aircraft operating under Visual Flight Rules (VFR).</p>

          <p>ATC's functions are divided into several segments.
          Ground control supervises aircraft taxiing to and from
          runways. The tower, or &quot;local control,&quot; handles aircraft
          in the vicinity of an airport, clearing them for takeoff
          or landing. Departure and approach controls manage the
          airspace surrounding one or more airports, and en route
          centers control traffic between airports.</p><a name=
          "Airbus Industrie"></a>

          <p><strong>Airbus Industrie</strong><br>
          Aircraft manufacturing consortium that includes France's
          A&#233;rospatiale, Germany's Deutsche Airbus, British
          Aerospace, and CASA of Spain. Based in Toulouse, France,
          Airbus is the world's second-largest manufacturer of
          commercial airplanes (after Boeing). Its major products
          are the A310, A320, A321, A330, and A340
          airliners.</p><a name="aircraft"></a>

          <p><strong>aircraft</strong><br>
          A flying machine. In the United States, the FAA divides
          aircraft into classes and categories. With respect to the
          certification of aircraft, classes are broad groupings,
          such as airplanes, rotorcraft, gliders, balloons,
          landplanes, and seaplanes. Categories define aircraft
          based on their intended use or operating limitations; for
          example, transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited,
          experimental, restricted, and provisional. With respect
          to the certification of pilots, class means a
          classification of aircraft with similar operating
          characteristics; for example, single engine, multiengine,
          land, water, and helicopter. Category means a broad
          classification of aircraft, such as airplane, rotorcraft,
          and glider.</p><a name=
          "Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association"></a>

          <p><strong>Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</strong><br>
          The world's largest aviation organization, dedicated to
          making flying safer, more productive, more affordable,
          and more fun. AOPA is headquartered in Frederick,
          Maryland.</p><a name="airfoil"></a>

          <p><strong>airfoil</strong><br>
          A device that interacts with a moving stream of air to
          produce lift or thrust. Wings, propellers, tail surfaces,
          helicopter rotor blades, ailerons and other control
          surfaces, and turbine blades are all
          airfoils.</p><a name="airframe"></a>

          <p><strong>airframe</strong><br>
          From 14 CFR Part 1: &quot;The fuselage, booms, nacelles,
          cowlings, fairings, airfoil surfaces (including rotors
          but excluding propellers and rotating airfoils of
          engines), and landing gear of an aircraft and their
          accessories and controls.&quot;</p><a name=
          "airline transport pilot certificate"></a>

          <p><strong>airline transport pilot certificate (ATP)</strong><br>
          In the United States, the pilot certificate required to
          act as pilot in command of an aircraft for an air carrier
          (airline) and for certain other operations. The ATP is
          often referred to as &quot;the Ph.D. of aviation.&quot; To be
          eligible for an ATP certificate, a pilot must be at least
          23 years old and hold a current first-class medical
          certificate. In general, an ATP applicant must also have
          at least 1,500 hours of flight time, including minimum
          amounts of time on cross-country flights, flights at
          night, and instrument flight time.</p><a name=
          "airship"></a>

          <p><strong>airship</strong><br>
          An engine-driven, lighter-than-air aircraft that can be
          steered.</p><a name="airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>airspace</strong><br>
          The part of the atmosphere that lies above the surface
          and is under the jurisdiction of a nation or controlling
          authority. In the United States, there are two categories
          of airspace: regulatory and nonregulatory. Within those
          two categories, there are four types of airspace:
          controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other.
          Airspace is assigned to one of the types according to the
          density and complexity of the air traffic using the
          airspace, the types of operations conducted in that
          airspace, and other factors.</p><a name="airspeed"></a>

          <p><strong>airspeed</strong><br>
          The rate at which an aircraft moves through the
          surrounding air. Pilots use several types of airspeed
          during flight. For example, indicated airspeed (IAS) is
          the speed shown on the airspeed indicator (usually in
          knots). Pilots use IAS to control an aircraft and manage
          its performance. Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is IAS
          corrected for instrument and installation error. True
          airspeed (TAS) is IAS corrected for changes in
          atmospheric temperature and pressure. Pilots use TAS to
          solve navigation problems.</p>

          <p>The aircraft's speed over the ground&#8212;ground
          speed&#8212;is TAS corrected for the effect of a headwind
          or tailwind.</p><a name="airspeed indicator"></a>

          <p><strong>airspeed indicator</strong><br>
          The instrument that displays an aircraft's speed relative
          to the air in which it is moving. Most modern aircraft
          have airspeed indicators calibrated in knots or in Mach
          number.</p><a name="altimeter"></a>

          <p><strong>altimeter</strong><br>
          The indicator that displays an aircraft&#8217;s present
          altitude. It is usually calibrated to give mean sea level
          (MSL) altitude. Most altimeters are called &quot;pressure
          altimeters&quot; because they measure the decrease in
          atmospheric pressure as the aircraft climbs. Because of
          this, the altimeter must be calibrated to the local
          atmospheric pressure to compensate for regional
          variations in pressure that would make the readings
          inaccurate.</p><a name="altimeter setting"></a>

          <p><strong>altimeter setting</strong><br>
          The value to which the scale of a pressure altimeter is
          set so it reads true altitude at field elevation. The
          setting is usually given in inches of mercury (Hg) or
          millibars.</p><a name="altitude"></a>

          <p><strong>altitude</strong><br>
          Height of the aircraft above a reference level. Altitude
          above ground level (AGL) is the absolute height above the
          earth. Altitude above mean sea level (MSL) is the height
          above the average level of the earth&#8217;s
          oceans.</p><a name="altocumulus"></a>

          <p><strong>altocumulus</strong><br>
          White or gray layers or patches of middle clouds, often
          with a waved appearance. Altocumulus clouds appear as
          rounded masses or rolls. They are composed mostly of
          liquid water droplets which may be supercooled. At
          subfreezing temperatures, altocumulus clouds may contain
          ice crystals.</p><a name="altocumulus castellanus"></a>

          <p><strong>altocumulus castellanus</strong><br>
          A type of middle cloud that includes some vertically
          developed, cumuliform protuberances (some of which are
          taller than they are wide, as castles). These cumuliform
          sections give the cloud a crenelated or turreted
          appearance that is especially evident when seen from the
          side. This cloud indicates instability and turbulence at
          the altitudes where it appears.</p><a name=
          "altostratus"></a>

          <p><strong>altostratus</strong><br>
          Stratiform&#8212;flat, layered&#8212;clouds that form in
          the middle altitudes. The height of their bases ranges
          from 6,500 to 23,000 feet (1,980 to 7,000 meters) in
          middle latitudes.</p><a name="anemometer"></a>

          <p><strong>anemometer</strong><br>
          An instrument for measuring wind speed.</p><a name=
          "aneroid barometer"></a>

          <p><strong>aneroid barometer</strong><br>
          A barometer that operates on the principle of changing
          atmospheric pressure bending a metallic surface, which,
          in turn, moves a pointer across a scale graduated in
          units of pressure.</p><a name="angle of attack"></a>

          <p><strong>angle of attack</strong><br>
          The angle between the wing and the oncoming
          airflow&#8212;the relative wind. It's important to
          understand that the angle of attack is related to the
          direction in which an aircraft is moving, not to the
          angle the wing makes with the horizon. In general, as
          angle of attack increases, so does the amount of lift a
          wing produces. However, at a specific point, called the
          &quot;critical angle of attack,&quot; the air flowing over a wing
          can no longer follow the airfoil's contour, and it
          becomes turbulent. The sudden loss of lift at this point
          is called a &quot;stall.&quot;</p><a name="angle of incidence"></a>

          "area forecast"></a>

          <p><strong>area forecast (FA)</strong><br>
          In the United States, a forecast of general weather
          conditions over an area the size of several states. It is
          used to forecast en route weather and to interpolate
          conditions at airports that do not issue terminal
          forecasts. FAs are issued three times a day by the
          National Aviation Weather Advisory Unit (NAWAU) in Kansas
          City, Missouri, for each of six areas in the contiguous
          48 United States. Other offices issue reports for Alaska,
          Hawaii, and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

          <p>An area forecast contains a 12-hour specific forecast,
          followed by a 6-hour (18-hour in Alaska) categorical
          outlook, giving a total forecast period of 18 hours. The
          information in an FA includes several parts, including a
          synopsis, VFR clouds and weather, and other items of
          significance to VFR flight, including thunderstorms and
          strong winds, if forecast.</p><a name="area rule"></a>

          <p><strong>aspect ratio</strong><br>
          The ratio between the length (span) and width (chord) of
          a wing. In general, a wing with a high aspect ratio is
          more efficient than a wing with a smaller aspect
          ratio.</p><a name="atmosphericpressure"></a>

          <p><strong>atmospheric pressure</strong><br>
          The pressure exerted by the air on the earth and
          everything on it. This is measured in inches (or
          millibars) of mercury on an instrument called a
          barometer. Thus, the term &quot;barometric pressure&quot; is
          frequently interchanged with atmospheric pressure.
          Typically, the pressure measures between 28 and 32 inches
          of mercury at sea level, decreasing at higher elevations.

          <p><strong>automatic direction finder (ADF)</strong><br>
          A radio navigation instrument that receives signals from
          nondirectional radio beacons (NDBs) or AM radio stations.
          The needle on the ADF indicator always points toward the
          selected radio signal. A pilot can determine the magnetic
          bearing to the station by using the formula, Relative
          Bearing + Magnetic Heading = Magnetic
          Bearing.</p><a name="automatic pilot"></a>

          <p><strong>automatic pilot (autopilot)</strong><br>
          A device that automatically controls an aircraft. Similar
          in concept to the cruise control feature on an
          automobile, simple autopilots keep an airplane's wings
          level. More sophisticated autopilots can fly an airplane
          from immediately after takeoff all the way to its
          destination and then make an automatic landing.
          Autopilots use gyros and other sensors to keep track of
          the airplane's altitude, speed, and position, and then
          send signals to the appropriate controls to keep the
          airplane on course and altitude.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>automatic terminal information service
          (ATIS)</strong><br>
          A continuous-loop recording played over a specified
          frequency that gives pilots the current weather, runway
          or runways in use, and other airport information. ATIS is
          available at many airports with an operating control
          tower. The tape is updated hourly or whenever there is a
          significant change in weather or airport information.
          Each update is labeled with a letter of the alphabet,
          which is pronounced according to the ICAO standard. For
          example, the broadcast at 11:00 a.m. might be designated
          &quot;Information Delta&quot;; the next update would be designated
          &quot;Information Echo.&quot; Pilots are expected to listen to the
          ATIS and indicate that they have received the current
          information before they make initial contact with air
          traffic controllers.</p><a name="autorotation"></a>

          <p><strong>autorotation</strong><br>
          The descent of a helicopter without power being applied

          follows a straight path through a series of turbine
          blades that compress the air before it enters the
          combustion chamber.</p><a name="axis indicator"></a>

          <p><strong>axis indicator</strong><br>
          In Flight Simulator, a display that shows the current

          <p><strong>bank</strong><br>
          The angle of an airplane's wings with respect to horizon;
          rotation about an aircraft's longitudinal axis. Pilots
          control bank using the ailerons. Airplanes turn
          principally because banking the wings creates a
          horizontal component of lift. Pilots measure bank in

          <p><strong>barometric altimeter</strong><br>
          A barometer that measures altitude by registering changes
          in atmospheric pressure as an aircraft climbs or
          descends. Large aircraft often are also equipped with a
          radio altimeter that measures the height of an aircraft
          by sending a radio beam to the ground and converting the
          time it takes to return into height above the surface.

          Beech and his wife, Olive Ann, founded Beech Aircraft,
          which became a leading producer of light airplanes.
          Earlier in his aviation career, Beech was a salesman and
          test pilot for the Swallow Airplane Company. Failing to
          persuade the company to adopt metal airframes, he quit
          and teamed up with Clyde Cessna and Lloyd Stearman to
          form the Travel Air Manufacturing Company, of which Beech
          was president.</p><a name="Bell, Alexander Graham"></a>

          <p><strong>Bell, Alexander Graham</strong><br>
          1847&#8211;1922. Scottish-born American inventor. Bell's
          early experience in teaching deaf students led to an
          interest in communications. By 1875, he was an expert in
          electric wave transmission, and the following year, he
          invented the telephone. In 1892, Bell became interested
          in aviation. He experimented with kites, photographed
          Samuel Langley's successful launch of the model
          Aerodrome, and later formed the Aerial Experiment
          Association with a group of young aviators that included
          Glenn Curtiss.</p><a name="Bernoulli, Daniel"></a>

          <p><strong>Bernoulli, Daniel</strong><br>
          1700&#8211;1782. Swiss scientist. His most important
          discovery, known as &quot;Bernoulli's principle,&quot; states that
          the total energy of fluid in motion remains constant: If
          its speed increases, its pressure decreases; if its speed
          decreases, its pressure increases. This principle was
          important to early scientists studying airflow, and their
          applications led to the design of wings capable of
          lifting heavier-than-air craft off the
          ground.</p><a name="Bernoulli's principle"></a>

          <p><strong>Bernoulli's principle</strong><br>
          The physical law stating that the total energy of fluid
          in motion remains constant: if its speed increases, its
          pressure drops; if its speed decreases, its pressure
          increases. Wings are designed to exploit this
          relationship by accelerating air that passes over their
          curved upper surfaces, thereby decreasing its pressure.
          The difference between the lower pressure above a moving
          airfoil and the relatively higher pressure below creates
          lift. This principle was first established by the Swiss
          scientist Daniel Bernoulli (1700&#8211;1782). Although
          aeronautical engineers continue to debate the theory of
          how lift is created, Bernoulli's principle is still
          regarded as a fundamental explanation of how airfoils
          produce lift.</p><a name="biplane"></a>

          <p><strong>biplane</strong><br>
          An airplane equipped with two pairs of wings, usually one
          above and one below the fuselage. Early-model biplanes
          had their wings connected to each other with struts and

          <p><strong>buffet</strong><br>
          Vibration, usually affecting the horizontal stabilizer
          and elevator, caused by turbulent airflow. Buffet occurs
          as the wing approaches its critical angle of attack and
          the smooth flow of air over the top surface of the wing
          becomes turbulent, like water flowing over rocks. This
          turbulent air strikes the airplane's tail surfaces and
          induces a mild vibration that the pilot feels through the
          flight controls. Pilots use the onset of buffeting as one

          aircraft can affect the accuracy of the airspeed
          indicator&#8212;especially at the low end of an

          <p><strong>call sign</strong><br>
          The identification that ATC and a pilot use for a

          combination of the aircraft type or manufacturer and the
          aircraft registration for civilian planes, a combination
          of the airline and flight number for airline flights, and
          a combination of branch of service and flight number for
          military flights. Call signs should always be included in

          <p><strong>canard</strong><br>
          A horizontal surface, mounted in front of an aircraft's
          main wing, that serves as a stabilizer to control pitch.
          Canards also reduce drag by cutting down the force
          generated by a conventional tail. Canards were first used
          in the pioneering days of aviation, and today, their
          principle advantage in modern design is in preventing
          deep stalls. The canard is designed to stall before the
          main wing, lowering the angle of attack of the main wing
          before that wing can stall. The term &quot;canard&quot; is also
          used to describe any aircraft that flies tail
          first.</p><a name="canopy"></a>

          <p><strong>canopy</strong><br>
          A transparent enclosure that covers an aircraft cockpit.
          Modern canopies are formed from a single piece of
          transparent plastic.</p><a name="canted gyroscope"></a>

          <p><strong>canted gyroscope</strong><br>
          A gyroscope within a flight instrument, usually the turn
          coordinator, with its rotational axis tilted, or canted,
          with respect to the aircraft's longitudinal axis. The
          tilted axis causes the gyro to respond to a banking or
          yawing motion.</p><a name="cantilever wing"></a>

          <p><strong>cantilever wing</strong><br>
          A wing attached to the fuselage without external struts
          or wire bracing.</p><a name="carburetor icing"></a>

          <p><strong>carburetor icing</strong><br>
          Because of the effect of vaporizing fuel and the decrease
          in pressure in the carburetor&#8217;s venturi, ice can
          form in the carburetor throat with the presence of
          moisture in the air. This can occur even on warm days
          with temperatures as high as 100 F (38 C), but is more
          likely when temperatures are below 70 F (21 C) and the
          relative humidity is above 80 percent.</p><a name=
          "carburetor"></a>

          <p><strong>carburetor</strong><br>
          The part of a piston engine that mixes fuel and air,
          creating a combustible mixture that is ignited and burned
          in the cylinders. Filtered air enters the carburetor
          through a venturi, a narrow throat. As the air flows
          through the venturi, its velocity increases. The air
          pressure drops, creating a partial vacuum that draws in
          fuel through a needle valve. The fuel, atomized into tiny
          drops, mixes with the air, and the mixture flows into the
          intake manifold, a tube with branches that delivers the
          mixture to each cylinder.</p><a name="category"></a>

          <p><strong>category (aircraft)</strong><br>
          In the United States, with respect to the certification
          of aircraft, a grouping based on intended use or
          operating limitations. In the United States, all aircraft
          are certified in a specific category. Examples include:
          transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited,
          restricted, and provisional. With respect to pilot
          certification, category refers to a broad classification
          of aircraft, such as airplane, rotorcraft, and
          glider.</p><a name="ceiling"></a>

          <p><strong>ceiling</strong><br>

          of clouds or obscuring phenomena that is reported as
          &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;overcast.&quot; The height of the ceiling is one
          of the factors that determines whether flight under
          visual flight rules (VFR) is possible. In the United
          States, the ceiling generally must be at least 1,000 feet
          (305 meters) for operations under VFR in controlled
          airspace.</p><a name="ceilometer"></a>

          <p><strong>ceilometer</strong><br>
          A cloud-height measuring system. It projects light on the
          cloud, detects the reflection by a photoelectric cell,
          and determines height by triangulation.</p><a name=
          "cell"></a>

          <p><strong>cell</strong><br>
          Another name for a thunderstorm or cumulonimbus cloud.
          Pilots, air traffic controllers, and meteorologists often
          use this term to report areas of intense precipitation,
          lightning, or turbulence associated with a
          thunderstorm.</p><a name="center of gravity"></a>

          <p><strong>center of gravity (CG)</strong><br>
          The point at which an airplane would balance if it were
          suspended by a cable. The CG is also the point at which
          the three axes&#8212;longitudinal, lateral, and
          vertical&#8212;of an airplane intersect and the point at
          which the four fundamental forces of flight&#8212;lift,
          weight, thrust, and drag&#8212;are assumed to act.<br>
          Pilots must ensure that the CG of a loaded aircraft falls
          within a specified range, called the &quot;CG envelope.&quot; If
          the CG is outside the envelope, the aircraft may be
          difficult or impossible to control. To determine the
          position of the CG, divide total aircraft movement by
          total weight.</p><a name="centerline"></a>

          <p><strong>centerline</strong><br>

          <p><strong>certified flight instructor certificate</strong><br>
          In the United States, a certificate that allows a person
          to give instruction to applicants for other pilot
          certificates. To be eligible for a certified flight
          instructor (CFI) certificate, a person must be at least
          18 years old and hold a current second-class medical
          certificate and a commercial pilot certificate. The
          applicant must demonstrate proficiency in teaching and in
          demonstrating the maneuvers required for various pilot
          certificates. A CFI certificate must be renewed every 24
          months.</p><a name="Cessna Aircraft Company"></a>

          <p><strong>Cessna Aircraft Company</strong><br>
          American manufacturer of aircraft founded in 1927 by
          Clyde Cessna. Production of the Cessna &quot;A&quot; series began
          in 1928, but the Great Depression brought business to a
          near standstill. However, the success of civil and
          military versions of the T-50 &quot;Bamboo Bomber&quot; created a
          wartime boom for Cessna that helped the company later
          produce more aircraft than any other
          manufacturer.</p><a name="Cessna, Clyde"></a>

          <p><strong>Cessna, Clyde</strong><br>
          1880&#8211;1954. American aviation pioneer and aircraft
          manufacturer. Inspired by the Moisant International
          Aviators' air circus, Cessna built his own monoplane and
          became a barnstormer. Later, he teamed up with Walter
          Beech and Lloyd Stearman in the Travel Air Manufacturing
          Company before forming the Cessna Aircraft Company in
          1927. Cessna retired in 1935, handing the reins to his
          nephew, Dwane Wallace.</p><a name="checklist"></a>

          <p><strong>checklist</strong><br>
          A procedure list used by pilots to systematically check
          and set an aircraft&#8217;s systems prior to takeoff and
          landing and during emergencies.</p><a name=
          "checkride"></a>

          <p><strong>checkride</strong><br>
          A flight administered by an examiner from a

          before issuing a pilot certificate to that
          individual.</p><a name="chord"></a>

          <p><strong>chord</strong><br>
          Also called the &quot;chord line,&quot; an imaginary line drawn in
          cross-section from the leading edge to the trailing edge
          of a wing. The chord line is the reference used to
          determine the angle of attack and to draw lift, weight,
          and other vectors when analyzing a wing that is producing
          lift.</p><a name="cirriform"></a>

          <p><strong>cirriform</strong><br>
          Clouds composed mostly or entirely of small ice crystals,
          usually transparent and white, often producing halo
          phenomena not observed with other cloud forms. Cirriform
          clouds include cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus
          clouds. The average height of cirriform clouds ranges
          upward from about 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) in the
          middle latitudes.</p><a name="cirrocumulus"></a>

          <p><strong>cirrocumulus</strong><br>
          A cirriform cloud appearing as a thin sheet of small
          white puffs resembling flakes or patches of cotton
          without shadows; sometimes confused with
          altocumulus.</p><a name="cirrostratus"></a>

          <p><strong>cirrostratus</strong><br>
          A cirriform cloud appearing as a whitish veil, usually
          fibrous, sometimes smooth. Cirrostratus clouds often
          produce halo phenomena and may totally cover the
          sky.</p><a name="cirrus clouds"></a>

          <p><strong>cirrus clouds</strong><br>
          Feathery, high-altitude clouds composed of ice crystals.
          Cirrus clouds typically form in shallow,
          scattered-to-broken layers on the equatorial side of the
          jet stream when high-level moisture is available. They
          indicate strong upper winds. Cirrus clouds do not in
          themselves constitute a hazard to aircraft, but they
          should alert pilots to the possibility of high-altitude
          turbulence and the approach of developing or intense
          weather systems.</p><a name="class"></a>

          <p><strong>class</strong><br>
          With respect to the certification of aircraft, this is a
          broad grouping of aircraft with similar characteristics
          of propulsion, flight, or landing. In the United States,
          the FAA recognizes the following classes of aircraft:
          airplanes, rotorcraft, gliders, balloons, landplanes, and
          seaplanes.</p>

          <p>With respect to the certification of pilots, this is a

          <p><strong>Class A airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, the airspace extending from 18,000
          feet (5,486 meters) above mean sea level up to and
          including Flight Level 600 (approximately 60,000 feet
          [18,288 meters]). Formerly known as &quot;positive control
          airspace (PCA).&quot; All operations in Class A airspace are
          conducted according to instrument flight rules (IFR)
          under direct air traffic control. Class A airspace is not
          marked on aeronautical charts.</p><a name=
          "Class B airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>Class B airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, the airspace around the busiest
          major terminals. Formerly called a &quot;terminal control area
          (TCA),&quot; Class B airspace is typically arranged in rings
          centered on the primary airport. The innermost ring
          usually extends from the surface up to 10,000 feet (3,050
          meters). The next rings each begin at different
          intermediate altitudes to allow nonairline traffic to
          transit the area beneath the Class B airspace and operate
          at satellite airports. This stair-step arrangement, drawn
          in cross-section, makes Class B airspace look like an
          inverted wedding cake.</p>

          <p>All aircraft operating in Class B airspace must
          receive a clearance from air traffic control, regardless
          of current weather conditions. Aircraft must also have a
          transponder with automatic altitude-reporting capability.
          The boundaries of Class B airspace are marked with solid
          blue lines on United States aeronautical
          charts.</p><a name="Class C airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>Class C airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, the airspace around airports that
          have an operating air traffic control tower, radar
          approach control, and a high level of IFR operations or
          airline traffic. Class C airspace is typically designated
          around second-tier airports that are not as busy as major
          terminals. Many military airports are also surrounded by
          Class C airspace.</p>

          <p>Class C airspace is typically arranged in two rings
          centered around the primary airport. The innermost ring,
          with a typical diameter of 5 nautical miles (nm),
          generally extends from the surface up to 4,000 feet
          (1,220 meters). The next ring begins at 5 nm from the
          center and extends to 10 nm. It begins at 1,200 feet (365
          meters) above the airport elevation and extends to 4,000
          feet (1,220 meters). Class C airspace also includes an
          outer area, which extends to 20 nm from the primary
          airport</p>

          <p>All aircraft operating in Class C airspace must
          establish communications with air traffic control,
          regardless of current weather conditions. Aircraft must
          also have a transponder with automatic altitude-reporting
          capability (Mode C). The boundaries of Class C airspace
          are marked with solid red lines on United States
          aeronautical charts.</p><a name="Class D airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>Class D airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, the airspace around an airport that
          has an operating air traffic control tower. Class D
          airspace is typically a circle centered on the airport
          with a diameter of about 5 cm. It typically extends from
          the surface to 2,500 feet (762 meters) above the airport
          elevation. Class D airspace often includes extensions to
          ensure that the controlled airspace encloses instrument
          approaches.</p>

          <p>All aircraft operating in Class D airspace must
          establish communications with the air traffic control
          tower, regardless of current weather conditions. The
          boundaries of Class D airspace are marked with dashed
          blue lines on United States aeronautical
          charts.</p><a name="Class E airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>Class E airspace</strong><br>
          Generally, in the United States, controlled airspace not
          designated as Class A, B, C, or D. Class E airspace
          includes low-altitude airways, extensions to Class D
          airspace, transition areas, and other airspace where air
          traffic control clearances are required when the ceiling
          and visibility do not meet the minimums for operations
          under visual flight rules (VFR).</p>

          <p>Class E airspace typically begins at either 700 feet
          (213 meters) or 1,200 feet (365 meters) above the
          surface. It extends upward to the base of any overlying
          controlled airspace. When designated as an extension to
          Class D airspace, Class E airspace begins at the surface.
          Aircraft operating in Class E airspace must establish
          communications with the air traffic control tower only
          when operating under instrument flight rules (IFR). The
          boundaries of Class E airspace are marked with dashed red
          lines or with shaded red or blue lines on United States
          aeronautical charts.</p><a name="Class G airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>Class G airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, airspace not designated as Class A,

          aeronautical charts.</p><a name="clear ice"></a>

          <p><strong>clear ice</strong><br>
          Relatively transparent ice with a homogeneous structure
          and few, small air spaces. Clear ice is usually
          associated with large, supercooled water drops typically
          found in cumuliform clouds. Clear ice forms when the
          liquid portion of a drop flows out over the aircraft
          surface before it freezes. Clear ice is hard, heavy, and
          difficult to remove.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>clear-air turbulence (CAT)</strong><br>
          Turbulence in an area where no clouds are present; in
          particular, turbulence at high altitudes. CAT is also
          sometimes used to describe turbulence associated with
          wispy cirrus clouds. Many phenomena can generate CAT, but
          it is often associated with the jet stream, especially in
          winter, when temperature contrast is greatest between
          cold and warm air. CAT also occurs in wind shears
          associated with sharply curved contours of strong lows,
          troughs, and ridges aloft, mountain waves, and areas of
          strong cold or warm air advection.</p><a name=

          increasingly used in the construction of modern aircraft
          because they are stronger and lighter than metals. Many
          new kit-built and experimental aircraft are built
          primarily out of composites.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>condensation</strong><br>
          The change of water vapor to liquid water.</p><a name=
          "condensation trail"></a>

          <p><strong>condensation trail</strong><br>
          A cloud-like streamer that frequently forms behind
          aircraft flying in clear, cold, humid air. Condensation
          trails are also called &quot;contrails&quot; and &quot;vapor
          trails.&quot;</p><a name="contrarotating propellers"></a>

          <p><strong>contrarotating propellers</strong><br>
          A pair of propellers, mounted one behind the other on the
          same engine, that rotate in opposite directions.
          Contrarotating propellers make more efficient use of the
          power from the engine and counteract the gyroscopic and
          aerodynamic forces generated by a single large propeller
          turning in one direction. The principle was first applied
          to an Italian Macchi-Castoldi racing plane in
          1933.</p><a name="controlyoke"></a>

          <p><strong>control yoke</strong><br>
          The steering-wheel-like control connected to the ailerons
          and elevator. A pilot turns the yoke to move the ailerons
          and bank the wings. The pilot moves the yoke forward and
          back to move the elevator, which lowers and raises the
          nose. Some airplanes have a stick or &quot;joystick&quot; instead
          of a control yoke.</p><a name="controlled airport"></a>

          <p><strong>controlled airport</strong><br>
          An airport with an operating control tower. You must
          obtain a clearance to take off or land at a controlled
          airport and follow the tower controller's instructions
          while operating on or around a controlled airport.
          Controlled airports are usually located within Class B,
          Class C, or Class D airspace. The basic rules for
          operating at an airport with a control tower are
          contained in FARs 91.131, 91.130, and 91.129 and in the
          Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).</p><a name=
          "controlled airspace"></a>

          <p><strong>controlled airspace</strong><br>
          In the United States, airspace in which operations may
          require a clearance from air traffic control (ATC),
          especially when a low ceiling or restricted visibility
          requires aircraft to operate under instrument flight
          rules (IFR). Controlled airspace is divided into several
          classes (A, B, C, D, E, and G) according to standards
          established by ICAO. Each class has different operating
          rules, including requirements for communications with
          ATC, specific clearances from ATC, pilot qualifications,
          aircraft equipment, maximum operating speeds, and minimum
          ceiling and visibility for operations under visual flight
          rules (VFR).</p><a name="convection"></a>

          <p><strong>convection</strong><br>
          In meteorology, atmospheric motions that are
          predominantly vertical, resulting in vertical transport
          and mixing of atmospheric properties.</p><a name=
          "convective clouds"></a>

          <p><strong>convective clouds</strong><br>
          Clouds exhibiting vertical development; cumuliform
          clouds. Convective clouds form in air that is moving
          primarily upward rather than horizontally.</p><a name=
          "coordinated flight"></a>

          <p><strong>coordinated flight</strong><br>
          Flight, especially during turns, in which the horizontal
          and vertical forces at work on the airplane are in
          balance. The inclinometer, part of the turn coordinator
          or &quot;needle and ball,&quot; shows the pilot whether the
          aircraft is in coordinated flight. When the ball moves to
          the inside of a turn, the airplane is
          &quot;slipping&quot;&#8212;that is, the angle of bank is too steep
          for the rate of turn. If the ball moves to the outside of
          a turn, the airplane is &quot;skidding&quot;&#8212;that is, the
          rate of turn is too great for the angle of bank.
          Uncoordinated flight can also occur during flight at low
          airspeed if the pilot does not apply enough rudder to
          compensate for the yaw force created by the propeller and
          engine at high power settings.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>coordinates</strong><br>
          The intersection of lines of reference, expressed in
          degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude and longitude,
          used to determine a position or location.</p><a name=
          "Coriolis force"></a>

          <p><strong>Coriolis force</strong><br>
          A deflective force resulting from the earth's rotation.
          In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects
          moving air to the right. In the Southern Hemisphere, the
          force deflects moving air to the left. The force acts at
          a right angle to wind direction and is directly
          proportional to wind speed. That is, as wind speed
          increases, Coriolis force increases. At a given latitude,
          double the wind speed, and you double the Coriolis force.
          Coriolis force also varies with latitude, from zero at
          the equator, to a maximum at the poles. It influences
          wind direction everywhere except immediately at the
          equator; but its effects are most pronounced in middle
          and high latitudes.</p><a name=
          "course deviation indicator"></a>

          <p><strong>course deviation indicator</strong><br>
          A vertical needle on the omnibearing indicator (OBI) that
          shows your deviation from the very high frequency
          omnidirectional range (VOR) radial set by the course
          selector. If the needle is to the right of center, the
          radial lies to the right of your current
          position.</p><a name="course selector"></a>

          <p><strong>course selector</strong><br>
          The knob or other control a pilot uses to select a VOR

          That removable portion of the airframe of an aircraft
          that covers the engine.</p><a name="crab angle"></a>

          <p><strong>crab angle</strong><br>
          The angle between an aircraft's heading and ground track.
          This angle is determined by the crosswind component and
          the airspeed of the aircraft; the stronger the crosswind
          and the lower the airspeed, the larger the aircraft's
          crab angle.</p><a name="critical angle of attack"></a>

          <p><strong>critical angle of attack</strong><br>
          The angle of attack at which a wing stalls. The critical
          angle of attack is determined by the airfoil design. A
          wing always stalls when it reaches its critical angle of
          attack, regardless of the aircraft's airspeed or
          attitude. Most general aviation aircraft have wings with
          a critical angle of attack of 18&#8211;20
          degrees.</p><a name="&gt;cross-country flight"></a>

          <p><strong>cross-country flight</strong><br>
          A flight from one airport to another covering a distance
          great enough to require the use of some form of
          navigation.</p><a name="crosswind"></a>

          <p><strong>crosswind</strong><br>
          A wind that is blowing at an angle to the flight path of
          an aircraft. Pilots must correct for crosswinds by
          pointing the nose of the aircraft at some angle into the
          wind in order to maintain the desired course across the
          ground.</p><a name="cruise speed"></a>

          <p><strong>cruise speed</strong><br>
          The average speed of an aircraft during

          settings.</p><a name="cumuliform"></a>

          <p><strong>cumuliform</strong><br>
          A descriptive term applied to all convective clouds that
          develop vertically rather than into horizontally extended
          stratiform types. Cumuliform clouds develop in unstable
          air.</p><a name="cumulonimbus clouds"></a>

          <p><strong>cumulonimbus clouds</strong><br>
          Dense, vertical cloud formations that usually produce
          heavy rain, thunderstorms, or hailstorms. &quot;Cumulus&quot; is
          from the Latin for &quot;heap&quot;; &quot;nimbus,&quot; for &quot;rain cloud.&quot;
          Like all cumuliform clouds, cumulonimbus form in unstable
          air. A cumulonimbus cloud is heavy and dense. It can have
          massive towers, often with tops in the shape of an anvil
          or plume. Cumulonimbus clouds are often associated with
          virga, precipitation, and low ragged clouds (scud),
          lightning, thunder, and sometimes hail. They occasionally
          produce a tornado or a waterspout. Cumulonimbus clouds
          can extend well into the stratosphere.</p><a name=
          "cumulonimbus mamma"></a>

          <p><strong>cumulonimbus mamma</strong><br>
          A cumulonimbus cloud having hanging protuberances, such
          as pouches, festoons, or udders, on the underside of the
          cloud. It is usually indicative of severe
          turbulence.</p><a name="cumulus clouds"></a>

          <p><strong>cumulus clouds</strong><br>
          Fluffy, flat-based clouds formed by rising, unstable air.
          &quot;Cumulus&quot; is from the Latin for &quot;heap.&quot; Cumulus clouds
          are usually dense and well defined. They develop
          vertically in the form of rising mounds; the bulging
          upper part often resembles cauliflower. Sunlit parts of
          these clouds are mostly brilliant white; their bases are
          relatively dark and nearly horizontal.</p><a name=
          "cyclic"></a>

          <p><strong>cyclic</strong><br>
          Cyclic controls a helicopter's pitch-and-bank attitude
          (serving the same function as the yoke or stick that
          controls the elevator and ailerons in an airplane). It is
          the primary airspeed control in flight. Applying forward
          cyclic causes airspeed to increase. Aft cyclic reduces
          airspeed.</p><a name="cyclone"></a>

          <p><strong>cyclone (low)</strong><br>
          An area of low atmospheric pressure with a closed,
          cyclonic circulation. Viewed from above, the circulation
          is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, clockwise
          in the Southern Hemisphere, and undefined at the equator.
          Because cyclonic circulation and relatively low
          atmospheric pressure usually coexist, in common practice,
          the terms &quot;cyclone&quot; and &quot;low&quot; are used interchangeably.
          Also, because cyclones often are accompanied by inclement
          (sometimes destructive) weather, they are frequently
          referred to simply as storms. &quot;Cyclone&quot;&quot; is frequently
          misused to denote a tornado.</p>

          center of gravity (CG) is often referenced from the
          datum. The aircraft manufacturer sets the datum for a
          particular airplane. Most manufacturers set the datum at
          the position of the firewall separating the engine from
          the passenger compartment or at the tip of the propeller

          <p><strong>da Vinci, Leonardo</strong><br>
          1452&#8211;1519. Italian artist and scientist; a man of
          towering intellect and a leader in the transition from
          the medieval to the modern European consciousness. Da
          Vinci's scientific interests included anatomy, botany,
          geology, optics, and mechanics. His designs for
          human-powered flying machines verged on the fanciful, but
          his sketches for a hypothetical parachute were
          scientifically sound.</p><a name="dead reckoning"></a>

          <p><strong>dead reckoning (de&#8217;d reckoning)</strong><br>
          The navigation of an airplane solely by computations
          based on airspeed, course, heading, wind direction and
          speed, ground speed, and elapsed time. The term derives
          from &quot;deduced&quot; reckoning. Also known as &quot;ded

          <p><strong>decision height (DH)</strong><br>
          The altitude at which, during an ILS or other precision
          landing approach, a pilot must decide whether to land or
          execute a missed approach. A typical ILS approach has a
          DH of 200 feet (60 meters) above ground
          level.</p><a name="density altitude"></a>

          <p><strong>density altitude</strong><br>
          Pressure altitude corrected for variations from standard
          temperature. Density altitude measures the actual density
          of the air and, therefore, is a critical factor in
          calculating aircraft performance. If the temperature is
          warmer than standard, density altitude is higher than
          pressure altitude, and vice versa. For example, assume an
          airport is 3,000 feet (914 meters) above sea level and
          the altimeter setting is 29.92 (1013.2 millibars). If the
          temperature is 90 F (32 C), the density altitude is 5,592
          feet (1,704 meters). An airplane taking off from this
          airport performs as if it's at nearly 5,600 feet (1,705
          meters). The engine produces less power, the propeller is
          less efficient, and the wings create less lift. The
          airplane uses more runway to reach takeoff speed and
          climbs at a lower rate.</p>

          The sudden, explosive burning of the air/fuel mixture in

          occurs when the air/fuel mixture is too lean&#8212;when
          there is not enough fuel for the current weight of air
          entering the cylinder. Detonation imposes excessive loads
          on the pistons and other engine components. If not
          corrected by enriching the mixture, detonation causes
          engine damage and may lead to sudden engine
          failure.</p><a name="dew"></a>

          <p><strong>dew</strong><br>
          Water condensed onto grass and other objects near the
          ground when the temperature of those objects has fallen
          below the initial dew point of the surface air but is
          still above freezing.</p><a name="dew point"></a>

          <p><strong>dew point</strong><br>
          The temperature to which air must be cooled to reach
          saturation, that is, 100 percent relative humidity.
          Weather reports usually include the air temperature and
          dew point temperature. A narrow &quot;temperature/dew point
          spread&quot; (less than 2.8 C or 5 F) indicates a strong
          likelihood of fog, clouds, or precipitation.</p><a name=
          "dihedral"></a>

          <p><strong>dihedral</strong><br>
          The angle at which an aircraft's wings tilt upward from
          the fuselage forming a slight &quot;V&quot; shape as seen from
          head-on. Dihedral increases stability about the
          longitudinal, or roll, axis of an airplane. It tends to
          level the wings after an airplane is established in a
          shallow bank. Anhedral, tilting the wings downward,
          produces the same effect, but it is much less

          <p><strong>distance-measuring equipment (DME)</strong><br>
          Avionics that determine and display distance in nautical
          miles. DME equipment, which operates in the UHF band, is
          usually installed at a VOR station. A complementary unit
          installed in the aircraft transmits timed pulses to the
          ground station, which replies. The unit in the aircraft
          converts the time between the pulses and the replies into
          distance and also derives ground speed and time to reach
          the station. The distance displayed by DME equipment is
          the &quot;slant range&quot; from the station, that is, the length
          of the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the
          aircraft's altitude and its distance from the station as
          measured along the ground. The difference between the
          slant range and the aircraft's actual distance from the
          station is negligible when the aircraft is more than
          about 10 nm from the station and at a moderate
          altitude.</p><a name="downburst"></a>

          <p><strong>drag</strong><br>
          The resistance of an object to movement through a fluid.
          With respect to aircraft, drag is one of the four
          fundamental forces in flight. It opposes thrust. There
          are two basic types of drag. Parasite drag is caused by
          friction. The airplane surface, antennas, landing gear,
          and other appendages all cause parasite drag, which
          increases in proportion to the square of the aircraft's
          velocity. Induced drag is a by-product of lift. At the
          tip of a wing, air moves from the high-pressure area
          below the wing to the low-pressure area above. The energy
          used to create these vortices manifests itself as induced
          drag, which increases as airspeed drops.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>drizzle</strong><br>
          A form of precipitation composed of small water droplets
          that appear to float with the air currents while falling
          in an irregular path. Drizzle differs from rain, which
          falls in a comparatively straight path, and fog droplets,
          which remain suspended in the air. In weather reports and
          forecasts, drizzle is indicated by the abbreviation DZ.
          On weather charts in the United States, drizzle is
          indicated by a comma (,).</p><a name=

          <p><strong>dissymmetry of lift</strong><br>
          A condition in which the main rotor of a helicopter does
          not produce lift equally across the entire rotor disk.
          This occurs only when in forward flight or hovering in a
          wind and is most apparent in a retreating blade
          stall.</p>

          the first woman to cross the United States nonstop (1932)
          and the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to California
          (1935). As an aeronautics adviser at Purdue University
          and an active proponent of women's aviation, she decided
          to attempt the first around-the-world flight made by a
          woman. Her second try in 1937 ended when she and

          <p><strong>effective translational lift</strong><br>
          When air moves horizontally across a helicopter blade,
          the rotor produces more lift at a given power setting.
          This occurs in forward flight or when hovering in a light
          wind. It might take 90 percent of a helicopter's
          available power to fly at 20 knots and take only 80

          <p><strong>elevator</strong><br>
          A movable control surface located on the horizontal
          stabilizer of an aircraft's empennage, or tail. Although
          its name implies that the elevator makes the airplane
          climb or descend, it actually controls only the
          aircraft's pitch attitude, that is, the angle of the nose
          above or below the horizon. The pilot moves the elevator
          by applying forward pressure on the control yoke or stick
          to decrease pitch attitude and by applying back pressure
          to increase the pitch attitude. On some aircraft, the
          entire horizontal stabilizer moves. This arrangement is
          often called a &quot;stabilator&quot; or &quot;flying tail.&quot;</p><a name=

          <p><strong>feather</strong><br>
          The action of turning the propeller blades until they are
          parallel to the aircraft fuselage. After an engine
          failure, a windmilling propeller can cause enough drag to
          seriously degrade aircraft controllability. Feathering
          reduces that drag by reducing aerodynamic forces on the
          prop, allowing it to stop windmilling. Feathering the
          prop is accomplished by moving the propeller levers in
          the cockpit into the feather position.</p><a name=

          States. The FAA regulates and certifies pilots, aircraft,
          airports, and airspace. It also manages the air traffic
          control system and supervises and inspects airlines,
          flight schools, flight instructors, maintenance
          technicians, and facilities. The FAA was created in 1958
          to supersede the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). It
          operated under the name Federal Aviation Agency until

          <p><strong>flaps</strong><br>
          A hinged portion of an airplane's wing, generally on the
          trailing edge, that can be lowered during takeoff and
          landing to increase the wings' lift and drag. When
          partially extended, a flap adds lift by increasing the
          camber, or curvature, of the wing. Because flaps extend
          into the oncoming air, they also increase drag, helping
          an aircraft descend steeply without building up speed.
          Modern aircraft use several types of flaps; the most
          common designs are plain, split, and Fowler. Often
          confused with ailerons, flaps are not the primary control
          surfaces of an airplane.</p><a name="flare"></a>

          <p><strong>flare</strong><br>
          To level off and establish the correct landing attitude
          just above the runway prior to landing. A pilot flares by
          applying back pressure to the control yoke or stick,
          which raises the nose of the aircraft. When done
          properly, the flare is a smooth, continuous transition
          from a nose-low, descending flight path to a nose-high
          attitude that almost stops the aircraft's

          pilots, coordinate flight plans, and assist aircraft in
          distress. In the United States, the FSS network includes
          one or more stations in each state. Each FSS typically
          has responsibility for a large geographic area. FSS
          specialists communicate with pilots over a network of
          remote transmitters and receivers. They also have direct

          <p><strong>fly-by-wire controls</strong><br>
          Electronic flight control system in which there are no
          direct mechanical links between the controls in the
          cockpit and the aircraft's control surfaces. A computer
          detects movements of the flight controls, interprets
          them, and sends signals to move the rudder, ailerons, and
          elevators. Fly-by-wire systems were first used in fighter
          aircraft to make aircraft more maneuverable and ensure
          that the pilot could not exceed the design limitations of
          the aircraft. Today, large transports, such as the Boeing
          777 and several Airbus models, include fly-by-wire
          systems.</p><a name="fractus"></a>

          <p><strong>fuel injection system</strong><br>
          A set of controls, pumps, nozzles, and other components
          used in many piston engines to deliver fuel to the
          cylinders. The system squirts fuel directly into the
          cylinders or just ahead of the intake valve, where it
          mixes with air. Because a fuel injection system requires
          high-pressure pumps, an air/fuel control unit, fuel
          distributor, and discharge nozzles for each cylinder,
          it's generally more expensive than a carburetor. However,
          a fuel-injected engine is more efficient than a
          carburetor, and fuel injection is used on most large
          piston engines.</p><a name="fully articulated"></a>

          <p><strong>fully articulated</strong><br>
          One of three types of main rotor systems used in modern
          helicopters. A fully articulated system utilizes three or
          more rotor blades that flap independently to compensate
          for dissymmetry of lift. Fully articulated rotor systems
          are more expensive than semirigid systems, but are less
          susceptible to low G conditions and mast bumping.
          However, they are more affected by ground
          resonance.</p><a name="fuselage"></a>

          crystal displays (LCDs). A number of gauges are combined
          into the displays, and the pilot can often flip to
          different &quot;pages&quot; to view navigation or aircraft system
          information.</p><a name="glide ratio"></a>

          <p><strong>glide ratio</strong><br>
          Ratio of horizontal distance traveled per unit of

          ground surface.</p><a name="ground effect"></a>

          <p><strong>ground effect</strong><br>
          A decrease in induced drag as an aircraft flies near the
          surface. The effect is caused when the ground interferes
          with the normal flow of air from below the wing to the
          low-pressure area above the wing. Ground effect is most
          apparent when an aircraft's height is about one-half
          wingspan or less above the surface. In practical terms,
          an aircraft flying in ground effect stalls at lower
          airspeed than normal. Pilots can use ground effect to
          lift off from a soft or short field with a minimum ground
          roll, but they must accelerate to normal flying speed
          before climbing away from the surface.</p><a name=
          "ground fog"></a>

          <p><strong>ground fog</strong><br>
          In the United States, a fog that conceals less than 0.6
          percent of the sky and that is not contiguous with the
          base of clouds.</p><a name="ground loop"></a>

          <p><strong>ground loop</strong><br>
          An aggravated, uncontrolled, tight turn on the ground,
          usually during rollout after landing or while taxiing. A
          ground loop often involves a turn of more than 90 degrees
          and frequently results in one wing touching the ground.
          Aircraft with tailwheels (often called taildraggers) are
          most susceptible to this loss of control because the
          center of gravity in such aircraft lies behind the main
          landing gear.</p><a name="ground school"></a>

          <p><strong>ground school</strong><br>
          The portion of pilot training that is conducted in a
          classroom on the ground.</p><a name="ground speed"></a>

          <p><strong>ground speed</strong><br>
          An aircraft's speed relative to the ground; an aircraft's
          true airspeed corrected for the effects of a headwind or
          tailwind. For example, if an aircraft is flying level at
          120 knots with a 15-knot headwind, its ground speed is
          105 knots.</p><a name="Gs"></a>

          <p><strong>Gs</strong><br>
          A measurement of the load factor, or apparent gravity,
          experienced by an aircraft during flight. One G
          represents the force of gravity exerted on a body at
          rest. When an aircraft climbs, turns, or accelerates,
          positive G forces act upon it. When it descends or
          decelerates, negative G forces act upon it.</p><a name=
          "gust"></a>

          <p><strong>gust</strong><br>
          A sudden, brief increase in wind. In weather reports and
          forecasts, gusts are indicated by &quot;G,&quot; followed by the 2-
          or 3-digit maximum speed, and units, usually knots (KT).
          For example, &quot;G25KT&quot; indicates wind gusting to a maximum
          of 25 knots.</p><a name="gyro"></a>

          <p><strong>gyro</strong><br>
          Short for gyroscope, an instrument based on a
          free-spinning wheel mounted within a ring. Gyros are used
          in instruments such as the attitude indicator, heading
          indicator, and turn coordinator. Because a spinning gyro
          maintains its orientation even when an airplane banks,
          climbs, or dives, it provides a stable reference to help
          pilots control an aircraft while flying in clouds or poor
          visibility.</p><a name="gyroplane"></a>

          <p><strong>gyroplane</strong><br>
          A type of rotorcraft that relies on aerodynamic forces to
          spin the main rotor during normal flight.</p><a name=
          "gyroscopic precession"></a>

          <p><strong>gyroscopic precession</strong><br>
          The reaction of a gyro when a force is applied to the
          spinning wheel. When force is applied to a gyro, it
          reacts as if the force had been applied at a point 90
          degrees from the point of actual application, in the
          direction of rotation. Precession affects propellers,
          which act like gyros, and gyro instruments. Its principal
          effect is on the heading indicator, which tends to drift
          over time.</p>

          <p><strong>hail</strong><br>
          Frozen precipitation often associated with thunderstorms.
          Hail forms when supercooled water droplets begin to
          freeze. After a drop has frozen, other drops latch on and
          freeze to it. The hailstone grows&#8212;sometimes into a
          huge iceball. As hailstones fall through warming air,
          they begin to melt, and precipitation may reach the
          ground as either hail or rain. Rain at the surface does
          not mean the absence of hail aloft. You should anticipate
          possible hail with any thunderstorm, especially beneath
          the anvil of a large cumulonimbus. In weather reports and
          forecasts, hail is denoted by the abbreviation &quot;GR,&quot; from
          the French, gr&#234;le.</p><a name="heading"></a>

          <p><strong>heading</strong><br>
          The direction in which the aircraft is pointed, usually
          in reference to magnetic north. Because wind pushes an
          airplane in flight, heading does not necessarily
          correspond to the aircraft's path over the ground, that
          is, its track. For example, if you want to fly due east
          with respect to the ground and the wind is blowing from
          the north, you must turn the aircraft slightly into the
          wind to correct for drift.</p><a name="headingindicator"></a>

          <p><strong>heading indicator</strong><br>
          A gyro instrument that accurately and quickly shows
          changes in aircraft heading, sometimes called the
          &quot;directional gyro,&quot; or &quot;DG.&quot; Because the heading
          indicator is driven by a gyro, it provides smooth,
          precise indication of heading or turns. The compass,
          which is subject to acceleration, deceleration, dip, and
          other errors, often oscillates or leads or lags a turn.
          However, because gyros are affected by precession, the
          pilot must periodically set the heading indicator to
          correspond to the compass (unless the heading indicator
          is &quot;slaved&quot; electronically to the compass).</p><a name="headwind"></a>

          <p><strong>headwind</strong><br>
          A wind that blows in opposition to the intended course of

          <p><strong>high-performance airplane</strong><br>
          As defined in FAR 61.31(e), an airplane that has more
          than 200 horsepower or that has retractable landing gear,
          flaps, and a controllable propeller. A private or
          commercial pilot may not act as pilot in command of a
          high-performance airplane unless a flight instructor has
          certified that the pilot is competent to fly such
          aircraft.</p><a name="holdingpattern"></a>

          <p><strong>holding pattern</strong><br>
          An ovoid-shaped pattern flown in reference to a fixed

          <p><strong>hood</strong><br>
          A view-limiting device worn by pilots who are learning or
          practicing flight by instruments. The hood covers the
          upper portion of the pilot's field of vision. A safety
          pilot or instructor must always accompany a pilot who is
          using a hood.</p><a name=

          display.</p><a name="horizontalstabilizer"></a>

          <p><strong>horizontal stabilizer</strong><br>
          The horizontal surface of the tail, or empennage. The
          horizontal stabilizer is an airfoil that creates a
          downward force on the tail to balance the upward force
          generated by the wing. It also incorporates the elevator,
          the control surface used to adjust the aircraft's pitch
          attitude. On some airplanes, the entire horizontal
          stabilizer acts as an elevator.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>hypoxia</strong><br>
          A condition in which an insufficient amount of oxygen
          reaches the tissues of the human body. The complete lack
          of oxygen, called anoxia, is fatal. Hypoxia is a serious
          hazard at high altitudes, particularly because its
          warning symptoms are varied and sometimes difficult to
          detect. Cabin pressurization or oxygen equipment is
          generally necessary for flying at altitudes at or above
          10,000 feet (3,048 meters).</p>

          <p><strong>Immelmann</strong><br>
          An aerobatic maneuver said to have been invented by World
          War I ace Max Immelmann in which an airplane reverses its
          direction of flight while gaining altitude. The maneuver
          begins with a half loop. At the top of the loop, the
          pilot rolls the plane upright. In modern aerobatic
          competitions, an Immelmann is called a &quot;half loop, half
          roll.&quot;</p><a name="Immelmann, Max"></a>

          <p><strong>Immelmann, Max</strong><br>
          1890&#8211;1916. One of Germany's first great fighter
          pilots, credited (probably erroneously) as the inventor
          of the &quot;Immelmann&quot; maneuver. Nicknamed &quot;the Eagle of
          Lille,&quot; Immelmann learned the basics of air combat from
          Oswald Boelcke, with whom he often flew missions. Among

          <p><strong>inclinometer</strong><br>
          An instrument that displays the inclination to the
          horizontal of an axis. In most aircraft, there is an

          The speed shown on the airspeed indicator uncorrected for
          variations in atmospheric density, installation error, or
          instrument error. Except at sea level under standard
          atmospheric conditions, IAS does not correspond to the

          <p><strong>induced drag</strong><br>
          The portion of total drag created by lift. Induced drag
          is created when high-pressure air below a wing swirls
          around the wing tip to the low-pressure area above. This
          motion creates vortices, which in effect siphon off the
          aircraft's energy. This lost energy is induced drag.
          Induced drag increases as airspeed decreases.</p><a name=

          airport.</p><a name="instrument approach procedure"></a>

          <p><strong>instrument approach procedure (IAP)</strong><br>
          An official procedure designed to guide aircraft to a
          runway when a visual descent isn't possible. IAPs
          describe the route and altitude aircraft are to fly as
          they transition from en route flight to landing. There
          are two basic types of instrument approach procedures:
          nonprecision and precision. Nonprecision approaches do
          not have an electronic glide slope to provide vertical
          guidance to landing aircraft. Examples of nonprecision
          approaches include VOR, NDB, localizer, and GPS
          approaches. Precision approaches have electronic glide
          slopes that provide precise vertical guidance. The most
          common precision approach is the ILS.</p><a name=
          "instrument flight rules"></a>

          <p><strong>instrument flight rules (IFR)</strong><br>
          In the United States, regulations that apply to pilots,
          aircraft, and aircraft operations when weather conditions
          do not meet the criteria for visual flight, when aircraft
          are operated in Class A airspace&#8212;that is, at
          altitudes at and above 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), or
          when pilots choose to operate in controlled airspace
          under those rules regardless of the prevailing weather.
          The rules establish minimum fuel reserves, equipment
          requirements and checks, and other operational standards
          for instrument flight.</p>

          <p>The abbreviation &quot;IFR&quot; is sometimes used to describe
          weather that doesn't meet the minimums established for
          flight under visual flight rules (VFR). For example, if
          an air traffic controller alerts a pilot to nearby
          traffic and the pilot is flying in the clouds, the pilot
          may say, &quot;I'm IFR&quot; and ask for a change in heading or
          altitude to avoid a conflict. The proper abbreviation for
          describing those conditions is &quot;IMC,&quot; for &quot;instrument
          meteorological conditions.&quot;</p><a name=
          "instrument flight time"></a>

          <p><strong>instrument flight time</strong><br>
          Flight time during which the pilot operates an aircraft
          solely by reference to instruments under actual or
          simulated instrument flight conditions. Instrument flight
          time is not necessarily the total time during which an
          aircraft operates under instrument flight rules
          (IFR).</p><a name="instrument landing system"></a>

          <p><strong>instrument landing system (ILS)</strong><br>
          A system of navigation aids and approach lights that
          provide both horizontal and vertical guidance to aircraft
          approaching a runway. The ILS is the primary
          precision-approach system in use today around the world.
          A typical ILS includes a localizer and a glide slope, as
          well as outer, middle, and inner marker beacons. The
          localizer transmits a directional signal that provides
          left/right guidance. The glide slope is an electronic
          glide path that defines the proper descent angle to the
          runway. Marker beacons indicate distance from the
          runway.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>instrument meteorological conditions</strong><br>
          Weather conditions that require flight under instrument
          flight rules (IFR). In controlled airspace in the United
          States, IMC conditions generally mean that the ceiling is
          less than 1,000 feet (305 meters) and flight visibility
          is less than 3 miles (5 kilometers).</p><a name=
          "instrument rating"></a>

          <p><strong>instrument rating</strong><br>
          A rating added to a pilot certificate that allows a pilot
          to act as pilot in command of an aircraft solely by
          reference to flight instruments. An instrument rating is
          required for operations in clouds or when the ceiling and
          visibility are less than required for flight under visual
          flight rules (VFR). A pilot also must hold an instrument
          rating to act as pilot in command of an aircraft in class
          A airspace. In the United States, class A airspace begins
          at 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) above mean sea
          level.</p><a name="instrument scan"></a>

          <p><strong>knots</strong><br>
          Nautical miles per hour. Abbreviation: kt, kts, or KTS.
          One nautical mile (nm or NM) measures 6,076 feet (1,852
          meters). This distance is based on the length of one
          minute of arc of a great circle&#8212;an arc representing
          the shortest distance between two points on a globe. One
          knot equals about 1.15 statute miles per hour; therefore,
          100 knots equals about 115 mph (185 kilometers per hour),
          150 knots equals about 172 mph (278 kilometers per hour),
          and 200 knots equals about 230 mph (370 kilometers per
          hour). All speeds filed on flight plans and for air
          traffic control purposes are in knots. In the United
          States, light aircraft manufactured in 1976 and later
          have airspeed indicators marked in knots. Earlier models
          had airspeed indicators marked in statute miles per
          hour.<br>

          <p><strong>landing gear</strong><br>
          The wheels, struts, and other equipment that an aircraft
          uses to land or maneuver on the ground. Also known as the
          &quot;undercarriage.&quot; The two most common types of landing
          gear are &quot;taildragger&quot; and &quot;&quot;tricycle&quot; arrangements. On a
          taildragger, the front of the aircraft is supported on
          two wheels, while the tail rests on the ground on a skid
          or a tailwheel. With tricycle landing gear, the aircraft
          sits level on the ground with one nosewheel and two
          wheels farther back on the aircraft. The main landing
          gear are those nearest the airplane's center of gravity.
          Main landing gear almost always come in pairs and are
          designed to withstand a greater landing shock than the
          more-fragile nosewheel or tailwheel.</p><a name=

          2 C (3.6 F) per 1,000 feet (305 meters). Weather
          forecasters and pilots use the actual lapse rate to
          estimate the altitude at which the temperature and dew
          point will merge and lead to the formation of clouds or
          precipitation. An increase in temperature with altitude
          is an inversion.</p><a name="large aircraft"></a>

          business jets. Despite the fact that his education
          stopped at the eighth grade, Lear built a successful
          electronics business. He sold it to finance a new
          aircraft company, which he started up in 1962 to build
          business jets based partly on fighters he had helped
          design for Swiss American Aviation
          Corporation.</p><a name="left-turning tendency"></a>

          <p><strong>left-turning tendency</strong><br>
          The result of four forces that together cause a
          propeller-driven aircraft to yaw to the left. This
          tendency is most pronounced when the airplane is flying
          at a low airspeed and a high angle of attack. The pilot
          compensates by applying and holding right rudder
          pressure.</p>

          <p>The four forces are: the reactive force, the spiraling
          slipstream, gyroscopic precession, and &quot;P factor.&quot; The
          reactive force is the opposite and equal force generated
          by the rotation of the propeller. This force induces a
          rolling motion about the airplane's longitudinal axis.
          The spiraling slipstream is the rotating column of air
          produced by the propeller. It swirls around the fuselage
          and strikes the left side of the vertical stabilizer,
          producing a left yaw. Gyroscopic precession occurs when
          the nose of the airplane rises or falls. This change in
          pitch attitude applies a force to the spinning mass of
          the propeller, which is 90 degrees ahead of the point
          where the force was applied. &quot;P factor,&quot; or asymmetric
          propeller loading, induces a left yawing motion because
          the downward-moving propeller blade has a higher angle of
          attack and produces more thrust than the upward-moving
          blade.</p><a name="lenticular cloud"></a>

          <p><strong>lenticular cloud (lenticularis)</strong><br>
          A species of cloud whose elements have the form of more
          or less isolated, generally smooth lenses, or almonds.
          These clouds appear most often in formations of
          orographic origin&#8212;the result of lee waves&#8212;in
          which case, they remain nearly stationary with respect to
          the terrain (standing cloud), but they also occur in
          regions without marked orography.</p><a name="lift"></a>

          <p><strong>lift</strong><br>
          The upward force produced by an airfoil, such as a wing
          interacting with the air. Lift acts at right angles to
          the relative wind or the aircraft's flight path. Lift,

          Light icing may become hazardous to aircraft without
          anti-icing or deicing equipment if conditions persist for
          an hour or more.</p><a name="light turbulence"></a>

          <p><strong>light turbulence</strong><br>
          In aviation weather reports and pilot reports, turbulence
          that momentarily causes slight, erratic changes in
          altitude, attitude, or both. When light turbulence
          produces rhythmic bumpiness without appreciable changes
          in altitude or attitude, it is called &quot;chop.&quot; In light
          turbulence, occupants may feel a slight strain against
          seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects may be
          displaced slightly. On large aircraft, food service may
          be conducted and walking is possible with little or no
          difficulty.</p><a name="lightning"></a>

          glider pilot whose experiments with stability, lift, and
          control were highly influential to such later aviators as
          the Wright brothers. Lilienthal applied his studies of
          bird flight and aerodynamic theory to the design,
          construction, and experimental flight of 18 gliders. The
          first man to be photographed in a glider, Lilienthal was
          killed when one of his craft crashed in 1896.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>Lindbergh, Charles A.</strong><br>
          1902&#8211;1974. American aviator who was the first pilot
          to make a solo, nonstop flight across the Atlantic, for
          which he won the Orteig Prize and the Medal of Honor.
          Lindbergh started his career as a barnstormer and airmail
          pilot. After his historic flight, he and his wife Anne
          mapped air routes for Pan Am. Lindbergh eventually moved
          to Hawaii, where he wrote several books, including The
          Spirit of St. Louis, which won a Pulitzer Prize in
          1954.</p><a name="load factor"></a>

          <p><strong>load factor</strong><br>
          The ratio between the total load supported by an
          aircraft's structure and the actual weight of the
          aircraft and its contents; also known as &quot;Gs.&quot; In
          steady-state flight, the load factor is 1. When an
          aircraft turns or pulls up out of a dive, load factor
          increases. For example, an airplane in a level turn at a
          bank angle of 60 degrees experiences a load factor of 2.
          In such a turn, the aircraft's structure must support
          twice the airplane's weight and the pilot must increase
          the aircraft's pitch attitude to produce more
          lift.</p><a name="local airport advisory"></a>

          <p><strong>localizer</strong><br>
          The component of the instrument landing system (ILS) that
          provides left-right guidance to a pilot approaching the
          runway. The localizer is a highly directional radio
          signal transmitted on one of 40 channels between
          108.10&#8211;111.95 MHz. The beam is funnel-shaped. It is
          typically 10 degrees wide 18 nautical miles from the

          <p><strong>Lomcev&#224;k</strong><br>
          A tumbling aerobatic maneuver. First conceived of by
          Ladislav Bez&#224;k, a former world-champion aerobatic
          pilot, the maneuver has at least five
          variations&#8212;all initiated from a near-vertical
          attitude and flown under negative G forces. Although
          Lomcov&#224;k is commonly believed to be the Czech or
          Polish word for &quot;headache,&quot; it apparently comes from a
          Slovak slang term for a large, stiff drink.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>longitudinal axis</strong><br>
          An imaginary line running from the nose to the tail of an
          aircraft; one of the three axes of an aircraft. Rotation
          about the longitudinal axis is called &quot;roll&quot; and is
          controlled using the ailerons.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>loop</strong><br>
          An aerobatic maneuver in which an aircraft flies in a
          complete vertical circle. An outside loop, begun at the
          top of the circle, is considerably more difficult to
          perform, because the pilot encounters negative G-forces
          throughout the maneuver.</p><a name="low"></a>

          <p><strong>low</strong><br>
          An area of low barometric pressure, including the
          attendant system of winds. Also called a barometric
          depression, or cyclone.</p><a name="low G"></a>

          <p><strong>low G</strong><br>
          A condition in which a helicopter's rotor blades have a
          load of less than 1 G (the weight of the helicopter)
          exerted upon them. This can occur due to abrupt cyclical
          control movements, flying in turbulence, or when pushing
          over from a steep climb. When pushing over from a steep
          climb, a low G condition will cause the nose to drop and
          the aircraft to roll to the right. The main rotor may hit
          the tail boom, and helicopters with semirigid rotor
          systems may experience mast bumping. Either effect could
          cause the loss of the main and tail rotors.<br>
          Recovering from a low G condition before losing control
          entails gently appling aft cyclic to raise the nose and
          load the main rotor. Apply left cyclic to counteract the
          right-turning tendency.</p>

          methodology and his theories on sensation and perception
          established the study of the philosophy of sciences. His
          work in ballistics and on measuring the speed of sound
          contributed greatly to the branch of aerodynamics
          concerned with supersonic flight.</p><a name=
          "Mach number"></a>

          <p><strong>Mach number</strong><br>
          The ratio of an aircraft's speed to the speed of sound.
          The speed of sound varies with the density of the medium
          carrying the sound waves. For example, sound travels
          faster through iron or water than through air. Because
          the density of air decreases with altitude, the speed of
          sound also decreases. Sound travels at approximately
          1,226 kilometers per hour (762 mph) at sea level, 1,138
          kilometers per hour (707 mph) at 20,000 ft (6096 meters),
          and 664 mph (1,068 kilometers per hour) at 35,000 feet
          (10,668 meters). Named for Ernst Mach, Austrian
          physicist.</p><a name="Mach 1"></a>

          <p><strong>Mach 1</strong><br>
          The speed of sound. Mach 1 varies according to altitude
          and temperature: At sea level, it is about 762 mph (1,226
          kilometers per hour); at the bottom of the troposphere,
          Mach 1 is about 660 mph (1,062 kilometers per hour).
          Above the tropopause, at about 36,000 feet (11,000
          meters), the speed of sound remains constant.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>magnetic compass</strong><br>
          A device for determining direction relative to the
          earth's magnetic field.</p><a name="magnetic course"></a>

          <p><strong>magnetic course</strong><br>
          A line drawn on a chart between two points with its
          direction referenced to the earth's magnetic North
          Pole.</p><a name="magneticdeclination"></a>

          <p><strong>magnetic declination</strong><br>
          See <a href="#magneticvariation">magnetic
          variation</a>.</p><a name="magnetic heading"></a>

          <p><strong>magnetic heading</strong><br>
          The direction in which an aircraft is pointed, measured
          relative to the magnetic north pole. The magnetic heading
          is displayed on the compass. A pilot determines the
          magnetic heading to fly by compensating for the
          difference between true north and magnetic north and then
          adjusting the resulting magnetic course to compensate for
          wind. If the wind is blowing directly along the intended
          course, the magnetic heading equals the magnetic course.
          If a crosswind component is present, however, a pilot
          must turn the aircraft slightly into the wind to
          compensate. Under these conditions, the airplane's track
          over the ground is slightly different from the direction
          in which the nose is pointing.</p><a name="magneticvariation"></a>

          <p><strong>magnetic variation</strong><br>
          The angle between &quot;true north&quot; and &quot;magnetic north&quot;; that
          is, the angle between the geographic North Pole and the
          magnetic North Pole as measured from a point on the
          earth. To determine the magnetic course between two
          points on the earth's surface, a pilot must determine the
          true course&#8212;the angle formed between the line drawn
          on a chart and lines of longitude&#8212;and then add or
          subtract the variation at points along that
          course.</p><a name="magneto"></a>

          <p><strong>magneto</strong><br>
          A device that creates an electric current by rotating a
          magnet. In aircraft engines, the crankshaft turns the
          magnetos, which provide the electrical energy to fire the
          spark plugs. This arrangement ensures that the spark
          plugs fire even if the aircraft's battery and electrical
          system fail. Certified aircraft engines typically have
          two sets of magnetos for additional
          redundancy.</p><a name="maneuveringspeed"></a>

          <p><strong>maneuvering speed (Va)</strong><br>
          The maximum speed at which the pilot can use full, abrupt
          control movement without creating excessive G forces that
          could damage the aircraft; the maximum speed at which you
          can safely stall an aircraft. Pilots also use maneuvering
          speed when flying through turbulent air.</p>

          <p>Abbreviated &quot;Va,&quot; maneuvering speed is not marked on
          the airspeed indicator.</p><a name=
          "manifold pressure gauge"></a>

          <p><strong>manifold pressure gauge</strong><br>
          An instrument that measures the air pressure in the
          intake manifold of a piston engine. Usually calibrated in
          inches of mercury, this instrument (really a barometer)
          is used in combination with the tachometer to set engine
          power. Most small training aircraft have only a
          tachometer. Aircraft with larger engines and aircraft
          with constant-speed propellers usually have manifold
          pressure gauges.</p><a name=

          flight</a>.</p><a name="marker beacons"></a>

          <p><strong>marker beacons</strong><br>
          Low-power radio beacons that identify specific positions
          along an instrument approach, usually an ILS. A typical
          ILS has at least two marker beacons. The outer marker
          (OM) normally indicates the point at which an aircraft
          intercepts the electronic glide slope. It transmits three
          dashes in Morse code. On the instrument panel, the OM is
          indicated by a blue light. The middle marker (MM)
          indicates a position about 3,500 feet (1,067 meters) from
          the runway threshold. It also marks the point where an
          aircraft is about 200 feet (61 meters) above the
          elevation of the runway touchdown zone. The middle marker
          transmits a &quot;dot-dash-dot-dash&quot; code and is indicated in
          the cockpit by an amber light.</p>

          <p>Some ILSs also have an inner marker (IM), which
          indicates the point at which an airplane flying along the
          proper glideslope reaches the decision height. The inner
          marker transmits a rapid &quot;dot-dot-dot-dot&quot; code and is
          indicated in the cockpit by a white light.</p><a name=
          "maximum L-D"></a>

          <p><strong>maximum L/D</strong><br>
          Maximum lift-to-drag ratio. This is the speed at which
          the aircraft will travel the farthest distance for a
          given altitude at a given weight. Also known as Best
          Glide.</p><a name="minimum sink"></a>

          <p><strong>minimum sink</strong><br>
          The speed at which the aircraft will lose the least
          amount of altitude over time at a given
          weight.</p><a name="mayday"></a>

          <p><strong>mayday</strong><br>
          The international call for help. The term comes from the
          French phrase, m&#8217;aidez (help me), pronounced
          &quot;mayday.&quot; This is the voice-transmission equivalent of
          the letters SOS used in code transmissions.</p><a name=
          "mean sea level"></a>

          <p><strong>mean sea level (MSL)</strong><br>
          The average level of the earth's oceans; used as
          reference for true altitude&#8212;the vertical distance
          of an aircraft above sea level. Airport, terrain, and
          obstacle elevations shown on aeronautical charts are
          expressed as true altitude.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>measured ceiling</strong><br>
          A ceiling classification applied when the ceiling value
          has been determined by instruments or the known heights
          of unobscured portions of objects other than natural
          landmarks.</p><a name="medical certificate"></a>

          <p><strong>medical certificate</strong><br>
          In the United States, a certificate showing that a pilot,
          required flight crewmember, or air traffic controller
          meets a set of physical and mental standards established
          for the safe operation of an aircraft or the performance
          of other duties. The FAA issues third-, second-, and
          first-class medical certificates. The certification
          standards are more restrictive with each class. Student,
          recreational, and private pilots are required to hold at
          least a third-class medical certificate, which is valid
          for either 24 or 36 months. A second-class medical is
          required for certain commercial operations. It is valid
          for 12 months for those operations and for 24 months for
          noncommercial operations. Airline pilots require a
          first-class medical, which is valid for 6 months for air
          carrier operations, 24 months for certain commercial
          operations, and 24 months for noncommercial
          operations.</p><a name="METAR"></a>

          <p><strong>METAR</strong><br>
          From the French term for Aviation Routine Weather Report,
          the worldwide standard report for hourly weather
          observations taken at airports. The United States
          recently adopted the METAR to replace SA reports. A METAR
          includes the following information: type of report,
          station designator, time of report, wind, visibility,
          weather and obstructions to visibility, sky condition,
          temperature and dew point, altimeter setting, and any
          remarks.</p><a name="microburst"></a>

          <p><strong>microburst</strong><br>
          Violent, localized winds often associated with
          thunderstorms. In a microburst, strong vertical
          downdrafts spill out of a thunderstorm and then spread
          along the ground, like water poured from a bucket. These
          downdrafts can exceed 6,000 feet per minute (1,829 meters
          per second) and create strong wind shears&#8212;areas
          where the speed and direction of the wind change
          abruptly. An airplane flying through a microburst and the
          associated wind shear experiences rapid changes in
          airspeed and can even sink to the ground if caught in a
          strong downdraft.</p><a name="middle marker"></a>

          <p><strong>middle marker</strong><br>
          A marker beacon located approximately 3,500 feet from the
          runway threshold. This is the point at which an aircraft
          will be approximately 200 feet AGL on the glide
          slope.</p><a name="millibar"></a>

          <p><strong>millibar (mb)</strong><br>
          An international unit of pressure equal to 1,000 dynes
          per square centimeter. It is convenient for reporting
          atmospheric pressure.</p><a name="mixed ice"></a>

          <p><strong>mixed ice</strong><br>
          A combination of clear and rime ice that can form
          rapidly. Mixed ice forms when water drops vary in size or
          when liquid drops are intermingled with snow or ice
          particles. Ice particles become imbedded in clear ice,
          building a rough accumulation, sometimes in a mushroom
          shape, on the leading edges of an aircraft's
          surfaces.</p><a name="mixture control"></a>

          <p><strong>mixture control</strong><br>
          A device for controlling the ratio between fuel and air
          entering an engine's carburetor or fuel injection system.
          In most aircraft, the mixture control is a push-pull knob
          or lever marked in red, usually located to the right of
          the throttle.</p>

          <p>Because aircraft engines operate over a wide range of
          altitudes, the pilot must adjust the mixture to produce
          the most efficient fuel/air mixture as an airplane climbs
          into less dense air or descends into more dense air. A
          mixture that is too rich contains too much fuel for the
          existing conditions and causes the engine to run rough
          and lose power. A mixture that is too lean can cause an
          engine to overheat or can cause detonation&#8212;the
          sudden, explosive combustion of fuel within the
          cylinders.</p><a name="mmo"></a>

          <p><strong>mmo</strong><br>
          Abbreviation for Mach maximum operating speed; the
          maximum airspeed, indicated in Mach number, at which an
          aircraft can be operated safely. The actual value of mmo
          varies with atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other
          factors.</p><a name="moderate icing"></a>

          <p><strong>moderate icing</strong><br>
          Ice, regardless of type, that accumulates at a rate that
          requires the use of anti-icing or deicing equipment.
          Aircraft without such equipment must divert
          immediately.</p><a name="moderate turbulence"></a>

          <p><strong>moderate turbulence</strong><br>
          In aviation weather reports and pilot reports, turbulence
          that causes changes in altitude or attitude and small
          variations in airspeed. The aircraft remains in positive
          control at all times, Occupants feel definite strains
          against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects
          are dislodged. On large aircraft, food service and
          walking are difficult.</p><a name="monoplane"></a>

          <p><strong>monoplane</strong><br>
          An airplane having only one main pair of wings.
          Monoplanes create less drag than biplanes, but early
          aircraft relied on biplane designs because of the ease of
          constructing a sufficiently strong plane this way. Once
          engineering advanced to the stage where strong monoplanes
          were possible, the biplane design became
          obsolete.</p><a name="Mooney, Al"></a>

          <p><strong>Mooney, Al</strong><br>
          1906&#8211;1986. American airplane designer and
          manufacturer. Mooney began designing light airplanes in
          1922. He worked for a number of aircraft companies around
          the United States, including Bellanca and Culver
          Aircraft, before joining Dart Manufacturing to design the
          Dart monoplane. Mooney designed his M-18 Mite in 1946;
          that same year, he and his brother Art founded Mooney
          Aircraft.</p><a name="mountain waves"></a>

          <p><strong>mountain waves</strong><br>
          A standing wave or lee wave to the lee of a mountain
          barrier; waves created by massive amounts of air pushed
          over mountain ranges, such as the Rockies and the Sierra
          Nevada in the United States. Intense mountain waves are
          typically produced when a strong, turbulent jet stream
          flows directly across a mountain ridge. Sailplane pilots
          often use mountain waves to soar to high
          altitudes&#8212;50,000 feet (15,240 meters) or more.</p>

          "pilot certificate"></a>

          <p><strong>pilot certificate</strong><br>
          In the United States, a pilot license. The FAA issues
          several types of pilot certificates, including student,
          recreational, private, commercial, certified flight
          instructor, and airline transport pilot certificates.
          Pilot certificates define broad privileges and
          limitations. Ratings on those certificates (single-engine
          land, instrument, multiengine land, helicopter, and so
          on) further specify the classes of aircraft that a pilot
          may fly and whether the pilot is allowed to act as pilot
          in command when the weather does not meet the minimums
          specified for flight under visual flight rules
          (VFR).</p><a name="pilot in command"></a>

          <p><strong>pilot in command</strong><br>
          The pilot responsible for the operation and safety of an
          aircraft during flight time. For purposes of logging
          flight time, a pilot holding a recreational, private, or
          commercial pilot certificate may log as pilot-in-command
          time (PIC time) only that flight time during which that
          pilot is the sole manipulator of the controls. The pilot
          must hold an appropriate pilot certificate and rating for
          the aircraft. An airline transport pilot may log as PIC
          time all of the flight time during which that pilot acts
          as PIC. A certified flight instructor may log as PIC time
          all flight during which that pilot acts as
          PIC.</p><a name="pilot report"></a>

          <p><strong>pilot report (PIREP)</strong><br>
          A PIREP describes actual in-flight conditions, such as
          the height of clouds, visibility, precipitation,
          turbulence, and icing. On weather reports in the United
          States, pilot reports are preceded by the letters &quot;UA.&quot; A
          pilot report includes the following items: position
          relative to a weather reporting station or navigation
          aid, time (UTC), altitude, aircraft type, cloud types and
          altitudes, visibility, outside air temperature, wind,

          1881&#8211;1970. American aircraft manufacturer who
          founded Piper Aircraft Corporation in 1937. Piper left
          his earlier career in oil exploration to invest in Taylor
          Brothers, builder of the E-2 Cub. He took over the
          company in 1932 and changed its name five years later.
          Piper Aircraft was, for many years, the world's leading
          producer of light aircraft.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>pitch</strong><br>
          Movement of an aircraft about its lateral axis (nose up
          or nose down), or the angle of an airplane's nose above
          or below the horizon. The pilot moves the control stick
          or yoke forward and back to move the elevator, located on
          the horizontal stabilizer. Forward pressure lowers the
          nose; back pressure raises the nose.</p><a name=
          "pitch-power rule"></a>

          <p><strong>pitch/power rule</strong><br>
          The pitch/power rule states that for normal flight,
          unless the throttle is fully open or fully closed, power
          changes should be used to change airspeed, and pitch
          changes should be used to change altitude.</p><a name=
          "pitot tube"></a>

          <p><strong>pitot tube</strong><br>
          A small metal probe, usually attached to a wing or the
          nose of an aircraft, that measures ram air pressure as
          the aircraft moves. The pitot tube is part of the
          pitot-static system. It is connected directly to the
          airspeed indicator, which displays the ram air pressure
          on a scale, usually calibrated in knots. The pitot tube
          usually has a heater to prevent ice from blocking the
          device. The probe is named after Henri Pitot
          (1695&#8211;1771), a French scientist who invented
          devices to measure the flow of water in rivers and
          canals.</p><a name="pitot-static system"></a>

          <p><strong>pitot-static system</strong><br>

          that measure, transmit, and display information about an
          aircraft's airspeed, altitude, and rate of climb or
          descent. The pitot-static system includes the pitot tube,
          static ports, and tubing that connects the sensors and
          instruments in the cockpit. The airspeed indicator is
          connected to both the pitot tube and the static ports.
          The altimeter and vertical speed indicator are connected
          only to the static ports.</p><a name="pivot point"></a>

          II and the Korean War, and founder and chairman of the
          Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). Poberezny
          organized the EAA and its first fly-in in 1953, from
          which he became a leading figure in representing the
          interests of sport-flying enthusiasts and amateur
          aircraft builders worldwide. Involved in aviation for
          most of his life, Poberezny has designed more than 15

          "precipitation-induced fog"></a>

          <p><strong>precipitation-induced fog</strong><br>
          Fog formed when relatively warm rain or drizzle falls
          through cool air. Evaporation from the precipitation
          saturates the cool air and forms fog.
          Precipitation-induced fog can become quite dense and
          persistent. It often extends over large areas, completely
          suspending flight operations. It is most commonly
          associated with warm fronts, but it can occur with
          slow-moving cold fronts and with stationary fronts.
          Precipitation-induced fog is especially critical because
          it occurs in precipitation and related hazards such as
          icing, turbulence, and thunderstorms.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>pressure altimeter</strong><br>
          An aneroid barometer with a scale graduated in altitude
          instead of pressure. Using standard atmospheric
          pressure-height relationships, a pressure altimeter shows
          indicated altitude (not necessarily true altitude). It
          may be set to measure indicated altitude from any
          arbitrarily chosen level.</p><a name=
          "pressure altitude"></a>

          <p><strong>pressure altitude</strong><br>
          The altitude indicated when the altimeter is set to 29.92
          inches of mercury or 1013.2 millibars. Pressure altitude
          is used in several important calculations, including the
          determination of density altitude, true altitude, and
          true airspeed. In the United States, aircraft operating
          at 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) or higher fly at &quot;flight
          levels,&quot; which are pressure altitudes. When operating at
          or above FL180, the pilot should set the altimeter to
          29.92 to display pressure altitude.</p><a name=

          integrated radar into their military defenses, and its
          value during the Battle of Britain was enormous. Today,
          radar is the primary tool for air traffic control. Some
          aircraft also carry weather radar, designed to detect
          precipitation and wind shears associated with
          thunderstorms and other hazards.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>radar altitude</strong><br>
          The altitude of an aircraft determined by radar or radio
          altimeter. It is the actual distance between an aircraft
          and the ground or water surface directly beneath
          it.</p><a name="radarsonde observation"></a>

          One of the 360 &quot;spokes,&quot; one for each degree in a circle,
          radiated from a VOR station. To fly a specific course,
          the pilot tunes the appropriate VOR station and selects a
          radial to fly. An indicator in the cockpit, called an
          OBI, shows the aircraft's position relative to that
          radial.</p><a name="radial engine"></a>

          <p><strong>radiation fog</strong><br>
          Fog characteristically formed over land at night or near
          daybreak when cooling of the earth's surface lowers the
          air temperature near the ground to or below the initial
          dew point. Radiation fog is especially common on calm,
          clear nights. It is relatively shallow and may be dense
          enough to hide the entire sky.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>rate of climb</strong><br>
          The speed (usually measured in feet per minute) at which
          an aircraft is climbing. The term sometimes is stretched
          to include the rate of descent. The rate of climb is read
          on the vertical speed indicator (VSI).</p><a name=

          "recreational pilot certificate"></a>

          <p><strong>recreational pilot certificate</strong><br>
          In the United States, a pilot certificate issued to a
          person who intends to fly only for recreation in basic
          aircraft. To be eligible for a recreational pilot
          certificate, a person must be at least 17 years old and
          hold a current third-class medical certificate. To earn a
          recreational pilot certificate, a person must acquire at
          least 30 hours of flight time, including 15 hours of
          flight instruction. Recreational pilots are subject to
          many restrictions. For example, they may not carry more
          than one passenger and must remain within 50 nautical
          miles of an airport where they received flight
          instruction. Recreational pilots are restricted to basic
          single-engine aircraft with no more than 180 horsepower,
          four seats, and fixed landing gear. They also cannot fly
          at night, above 10,000 feet (3000 meters), or when the
          visibility is less than 3 sm.</p><a name=
          "relative humidity"></a>

          <p><strong>relative humidity</strong><br>
          The ratio, usually expressed in percent, between the
          amount of water present in the air and the maximum amount
          that could be present at a given temperature. Warm air
          can hold more water vapor than cool air. If temperature
          increases and the amount of water vapor in the air
          remains constant, relative humidity decreases. If
          temperature drops while the amount of water vapor stays
          constant, relative humidity increases. Air with 100
          percent relative humidity is said to be &quot;saturated.&quot; The
          temperature at which the air reaches 100 percent relative
          humidity is called the &quot;dew point.&quot;</p><a name=
          "relative wind"></a>

          <p><strong>relative wind</strong><br>
          The speed and direction of air striking an airfoil; that
          is, the air flow caused by an aircraft or airfoil's
          movement through the air. The relative wind blows
          parallel and opposite to the aircraft's flight path. The
          angle between the relative wind and the chord line is the
          angle of attack. Lift acts perpendicular to the relative
          wind.</p><a name="resolution"></a>

          <p><strong>resolution</strong><br>
          The level of graphics detail displayed on a computer
          screen.</p><a name="retractable gear"></a>

          <p><strong>retractable gear</strong><br>
          Landing gear that can be retracted into the fuselage of
          an aircraft. Though they are more complex than
          fixed-gear, the ability to retract the gear provides a
          significant reduction in drag.</p><a name=
          "retreating blade stall"></a>

          <p><strong>retreating blade stall</strong><br>
          A condition in which a helicopter's rotor blades on the
          left side of the rotor disk (as viewed from above) exceed
          their critical angle of attack and stall. This is most
          apparent during high forward speed and is the primary
          limiting factor on a helicopter's maximum speed. Recovery
          from a retreating blade stall entails lowering the
          collective to reduce the rotor blade's angle of attack
          and slowing down.</p><a name="reverse thrust"></a>

          <p><strong>reverse thrust</strong><br>
          An engine's thrust directed forward to help slow the
          aircraft's forward motion. On turbojet aircraft, this is
          accomplished by the use of moveable devices that are
          extended across the engine's exhaust path or by movement
          of the cowling on high-bypass turbofans. On turboprop
          engines, this is accomplished by movement of the
          propeller blades into a position that directs thrust
          forward.</p><a name="ridge"></a>

          <p><strong>ridge</strong><br>
          In meteorology, an elongated area of relatively high
          atmospheric pressure; usually associated with and most
          clearly identified as an area of maximum anticyclonic
          curvature of the wind flow. In soaring, rising terrain
          that is often accompanied by rising air.</p><a name=
          "ridge lift"></a>

          <p><strong>ridge lift</strong><br>
          An area of rising air created when wind blows against the
          side of a ridge and is deflected upward. In such
          conditions, sailplanes can stay aloft for hours by flying
          parallel to a ridge and riding those rising currents of
          air.</p><a name="rigid"></a>

          <p><strong>rigid</strong><br>
          One of three main types of main rotor systems used in
          modern helicopters. A rigid rotor system utilizes three
          or more rotor blades that flap independently to
          compensate for dissymmetry of lift. Unlike the fully
          articulated system, the rigid system is hingeless, and
          the rotors can lead and lag independently.<br>
          Rigid rotor systems are typically made of composite
          materials and titanium (and are, therefore, expensive)
          and tend to give a rough ride. They resist low G
          conditions and ground resonance, and are less expensive
          to maintain than other rotor systems.</p><a name=
          "rime ice"></a>

          <p><strong>rime ice</strong><br>
          White or milky and opaque granular deposits of ice formed
          by the rapid freezing of supercooled water droplets on
          exposed parts of an aircraft. Rime ice forms when drops
          are small, usually in stratiform clouds or light drizzle.
          The liquid portion remaining after initial impact freezes
          before the drop spreads over the aircraft surface. The
          small frozen droplets trap air between them, giving the
          ice a milky appearance. Rime ice is lighter than clear
          ice, but its irregular shape and rough surface quickly
          degrade the efficiency of airfoils.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>roll</strong><br>
          Rotation about an aircraft's longitudinal axis. The pilot
          controls roll, or the bank of the wings, with the
          ailerons. A roll is also an aerobatic maneuver in which
          an airplane rotates completely around its longitudinal
          axis.</p><a name="roll cloud"></a>

          <p><strong>roll cloud</strong><br>
          A dense and horizontal roll-shaped accessory cloud
          located on the lower leading edge of a cumulonimbus. Roll
          clouds can also be found near a rapidly developing
          cumulus cloud. They indicate turbulence.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>rotary engine</strong><br>
          Type of piston engine, common in World War I aircraft,
          with a stationary crankshaft and cylinders that rotate
          around the crankshaft. Rotary engines were
          lighter-weight, more reliable, and more easily cooled
          than many contemporary radial and inline piston engines,
          but they had high fuel consumption and their rotational
          inertia sometimes made an aircraft difficult to
          maneuver.</p><a name="rotation"></a>

          <p><strong>rudder</strong><br>
          A movable control surface usually mounted on the vertical
          stabilizer of the tail. The rudder moves the aircraft
          about its vertical, or yaw, axis. It does not, however,
          turn the airplane. It is used primarily to balance forces
          in turns and to counteract yawing motions induced by the
          propeller during flight. A pilot moves the rudder by
          applying pressure to the left or right rudder pedal. The
          pedals are mounted on the floor of the cockpit. In normal
          maneuvering, the pilot uses simultaneous aileron and
          rudder pressures to maintain balanced or coordinated
          flight.</p><a name="runway"></a>

          <p><strong>run-up</strong><br>
          Before taking the runway for takeoff, most pilots of
          piston-powered aircraft &quot;run up&quot; the engine(s) to a high
          rpm setting to test the magnetos and carburetor heat, and
          to check vacuum system suction, among other things.

          The horizontal distance (in feet or meters) that a pilot
          should be able to see down the runway from the approach
          end. RVR is based on either the sighting of high
          intensity runway lights or on the visual contrast of
          other objects, whichever yields the greatest visual
          range.</p>

          <p><strong>S turn</strong><br>
          A taxiing technique employed by pilots of tailwheel
          aircraft. Due to the attitude of a taildragger when
          it&#8217;s sitting on the ground, the nose of the
          aircraft limits forward visibility. By alternately
          turning the aircraft left and right, the pilot can see
          ahead of the aircraft.</p>

          <p>Also refers to a technique used in flight during

          <p><strong>Santos-Dumont, Alberto</strong><br>
          1873&#8211;1932. Brazilian-born inventor of dirigibles
          and airplanes who made the first powered flight in
          Europe. Santos-Dumont made his first balloon flight early
          in 1898; later that year, he became the first to fly a
          balloon equipped with an engine. In 1906, he flew his
          boxlike &quot;14-bis&quot; flying machine 722 feet (220 meters) for
          the first powered flight outside the United States.
          Santos-Dumont retired from aviation in 1910. In 1932,
          depressed over the military use of aircraft, he took his
          own life.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>saturated adiabatic lapse rate</strong><br>
          The rate of decrease of temperature with height as

          <p><strong>semirigid</strong><br>
          One of three main types of main rotor systems used in
          modern helicopters. A semirigid rotor system utilizes two
          rotor blades that flap together as a unit to compensate
          for dissymmetry of lift. Semirigid rotor systems are
          relatively inexpensive to maintain but are susceptible to
          low G conditions, and their flapping characteristics can
          lead to mast bumping.</p><a name=
          "settling with power"></a>

          <p><strong>settling with power</strong><br>
          Also called a retreating blade stall. A condition in
          which a helicopter's rotor blades on the left side of the
          rotor disk (as viewed from above) exceed their critical
          angle of attack and stall. This is most apparent during
          high forward speed and is the primary limiting factor on
          a helicopter's maximum speed. Recovery from a retreating
          blade stall entails lowering the collective to reduce the

          In aviation weather reports and pilot reports, turbulence
          that causes large, abrupt changes in altitude, attitude,
          or both. Severe turbulence usually causes wide variations
          in indicated airspeed. The aircraft may be momentarily
          out of control. Occupants are forced violently against
          seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects are
          tossed about. On large aircraft, food service and walking
          are impossible.</p><a name="shaft horsepower"></a>

          <p><strong>shaft horsepower (SHP)</strong><br>
          A power output measurement for turboprop engines. SHP is

          of exhaust and shaft forces is called Equivalent Shaft
          Horsepower (ESHP).</p><a name="shock wave"></a>

          <p><strong>shock wave</strong><br>
          Created when airflow changes abruptly from subsonic to
          supersonic speed, causing an enormous increase in air
          pressure and temperature. When an aircraft travels above
          Mach 1, shock waves bend backward to form a cone. If this
          cone reaches the earth's surface, it causes an explosive
          sound called a sonic boom.</p><a name="shower"></a>

          ends, by a rapid change of intensity, and usually by
          rapid change in the appearance of the sky. Showery
          precipitation may be in the form of rain, ice pellets, or
          snow.</p><a name="SIGMET advisory"></a>

          <p><strong>SIGMET advisory (significant meteorological

          An advisory of concern to all aircraft that covers severe
          weather conditions.</p><a name="Sikorsky, Igor"></a>

          <p><strong>Sikorsky, Igor</strong><br>
          1889&#8211;1972. Russian-born aircraft designer and
          manufacturer considered to be &quot;the father of the
          helicopter.&quot; Sikorsky built his first helicopter at age
          20, and in 1913, he built the world's first four-engine
          airplane. After moving to the United States in 1919, he
          formed an aircraft company with other Russian
          &#233;migr&#233;s. Sikorsky's flying boats, although a
          technical success, were a financial failure, so with
          support from United Air Transport, he returned to
          helicopters. In 1939, his VS-300 became the first
          practical helicopter.</p><a name="sinkrate"></a>

          <p><strong>sink rate</strong><br>
          Negative vertical velocity, usually expressed in feet per
          second.</p><a name="simplified directional facility"></a>

          <p><strong>simplified directional facility</strong><br>
          A navigational aid used for nonprecision approaches.
          Similar to an ILS, but not as accurate.</p><a name=
          "skid"></a>

          <p><strong>skid</strong><br>
          A turn in which the rate of turn is too great for the
          angle of the bank. In a skid, the ball at the bottom of
          the turn coordinator moves to the outside of the turn. To
          correct a skid, use the ailerons to increase the bank,
          reduce rudder pressure, or both, in the direction of the
          turn.</p><a name="slat"></a>

          <p><strong>slat</strong><br>
          A movable auxiliary airfoil on the leading edge of a
          wing. The slat extends into the flow of air and creates a
          gap that allows air to flow smoothly over the top of the
          wing, delaying the stall at high angles of
          attack.</p><a name="slewing"></a>

          <p><strong>slewing</strong><br>
          In Flight Simulator, a method of rapidly changing

          without flying.</p><a name="slip"></a>

          <p><strong>slip</strong><br>
          A turn in which the rate of turn is too slow for the
          angle of the bank. In a slip, the ball at the bottom of
          the turn coordinator moves to the inside of the turn. To
          correct for a slip, use the ailerons to decrease the
          bank, increase rudder pressure, or both, in the direction
          of the turn. Pilots also use forward slips and side slips
          to correct for crosswinds during landings and to increase
          an aircraft's rate of descent without increasing its
          airspeed.</p><a name="slow flight"></a>

          <p><strong>slow flight</strong><br>

          aircraft.</p><a name="speed brakes"></a>

          <p><strong>speed brakes</strong><br>
          A type of secondary control on a highly streamlined
          aircraft designed to allow it to descend rapidly without
          an excess buildup of airspeed. Speed brakes produce drag
          without affecting lift or changing the aircraft&#8217;s
          pitch.</p><a name="spin"></a>

          <p><strong>spin</strong><br>
          A steep, spiraling descent during which an aircraft is
          stalled and rotating rapidly. The characteristic rotation
          is the result of a strong yawing moment that occurs when
          one wing is stalled while the other still produces some
          lift.</p><a name="spoilers"></a>

          <p><strong>spoilers</strong><br>
          Panels on an aircraft's wings that disrupt the flow of
          air over the wing surface. Spoilers reduce the wing's
          lift and increase drag. They enable a jet aircraft to
          make a rapid descent without building excess speed. They
          are also used immediately after landing to &quot;dump&quot; lift
          and increase braking efficiency. Sailplane pilots also
          use spoilers during descent and landing to control their
          rate of descent.</p><a name="spool up"></a>

          it from another plane flying alongside.</p><a name=
          "squall"></a>

          <p><strong>squall</strong><br>
          A sudden increase in wind speed by at least 15 knots to a
          peak of 20 knots or more and lasting for at least one
          minute. The essential difference between a gust and a
          squall is the duration of the peak speed.</p><a name=
          "squall line"></a>

          <p><strong>squall line</strong><br>
          A narrow band of active, often severe, thunderstorms not
          associated with a front. Squall lines often form ahead of
          a cold front in moist, unstable air, but they can also
          develop in unstable air far removed from any front.
          Squall lines present the single most-intense weather
          hazard to aircraft. They usually develop rapidly and
          reach maximum intensity during the late afternoon and
          early evening. Squall lines may also be too long to fly
          around and too wide and severe to fly through, creating a
          true barrier in the sky.</p><a name=
          "stability (aircraft)"></a>

          <p><strong>stability (aircraft)</strong><br>
          Generally, a measure of how an object reacts after it is
          disturbed by an outside force. Aircraft stability is
          classified as three types. Positive stability is the
          tendency to return to steady-state flight after a change
          in attitude or power. Aircraft are generally designed to
          exhibit positive stability. An aircraft with neutral
          stability would remain in the new attitude after being
          disturbed and would not return to its initial condition.
          An aircraft with negative stability would diverge from
          its initial condition, with the oscillations increasing
          with time.</p>

          <p>Stability can also be classified as &quot;static&quot; and
          &quot;dynamic.&quot; Static stability is the initial tendency to
          return to equilibrium. Dynamic stability refers to the
          dampening of oscillations over time.</p><a name=
          "stability(atmospheric)"></a>

          <p><strong>stability (atmospheric)</strong><br>
          A measure of the vertical movement of air within an air
          mass. More specifically, it is a state of the atmosphere
          in which the vertical distribution of temperature is such
          that a parcel of air resists displacement from its
          initial level.</p><a name="stabilizer"></a>

          stabilizer</a>, <a href="#verticalstabilizer">vertical
          stabilizer</a>.</p><a name="stall"></a>

          <p><strong>stall</strong><br>
          A sudden loss of lift caused by a disruption of the
          normal smooth flow of air over the upper surface of a
          wing. A stall is an aerodynamic phenomenon and has
          nothing to do with the engine. A stall occurs when a
          wing's angle of attack reaches a specific value, called
          the critical angle of attack. It is this angle between
          the wing and the oncoming air&#8212;not the airplane's
          speed, weight, or pitch attitude relative to the
          horizon&#8212;that determines when a wing stalls. In
          fact, an airplane can stall at any airspeed and in any
          attitude.</p><a name="stall speed"></a>

          <p><strong>stall speed</strong><br>
          The speed at which an aircraft enters a stall under a
          specified set of conditions. Although an airplane always
          stalls when the wing's angle of attack reaches the
          critical angle of attack, the speed at which the stall
          occurs depends on the aircraft's weight, load factor, the
          amount of thrust being produced, angle of bank, position
          of flaps and landing gear, and other factors.<br>
          In fact, an airplane can stall at any
          airspeed&#8212;because regardless of speed, a stall
          occurs only when the angle between the relative wind
          (parallel and opposite to the aircraft's flight path) and
          the wing reaches the critical angle of
          attack.</p><a name="standard atmosphere"></a>

          <p><strong>standard atmosphere</strong><br>
          A hypothetical atmosphere based on climatological
          averages. The most important constants defined in the
          standard atmosphere are: a surface temperature of 15 C
          (59 F) and a surface pressure of 1,013.2 millibars (29.92
          inches of mercury) at sea level; a lapse rate in the
          troposphere of approximately 2 C (3.6 F) per 1,000 feet
          (6.5 C per kilometer), a drop in pressure of
          approximately 1 inch of mercury per 1,000 feet (110
          millibars per 1,000 meters), a tropopause of
          approximately 36,000 feet (11 kilometers) with a
          temperature of &#8211;56.5 C; and an isothermal lapse
          rate in the stratosphere to an altitude of approximately
          80,000 feet (24 kilometers).</p><a name=

          <p><strong>standard conditions</strong><br>
          An arbitrary standard established as a baseline for
          calculations used in meteorology, aviation, and
          aerodynamics. A set of standard conditions exists for
          each altitude. At sea level, standard conditions are
          defined as 29.92 inches of mercury (1,013 millibars) and
          59 F (15 C).</p><a name=

          STARs are designed to facilitate air traffic
          control.</p><a name="Standard Instrument Departure"></a>

          <p><strong>Standard Instrument Departure (SID)</strong><br>
          A published procedure that provides an efficient route

          plan. SIDs are designed to facilitate air traffic
          control.</p><a name="standard pressure"></a>

          <p><strong>standard pressure</strong><br>
          An arbitrary standard established as a baseline for
          calculations used in meteorology, aviation, and
          aerodynamics. A standard pressure is defined at all
          altitudes. At sea level, the standard is 29.92 inches of
          mercury or 1,013 millibars.</p><a name=
          "standard rate turn"></a>

          <p><strong>standard rate turn</strong><br>
          A turn of either 3 degrees or 1.5 degrees per second.
          Small aircraft typically use the 3 degrees per second
          rate, which results in a 360-degree turn after 2 minutes.
          Large, fast aircraft typically use the slower rate, which
          results in a 360-degree turn after 4 minutes. Pilots use
          the standard rate turn while flying under Instrument
          Flight Rules (IFR). It provides a steady, predictable,
          and easy-to-control rate of turn. Standard rate turns are
          also useful if the heading indicator fails. The pilot can
          make accurate turns to specific headings by banking at
          the standard rate and timing the turn.</p><a name=
          "standard temperature"></a>

          <p><strong>standard temperature</strong><br>
          An arbitrary standard used by aeronautical engineers and
          pilots in calculations to determine aircraft performance,
          true airspeed, true altitude, and so forth. The standard
          temperature is part of the definition of the
          International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). At sea level,
          the standard temperature is defined as 59 F (15 C). The
          standard temperature of dry air drops by about 3.5 F (2
          C) per 1,000 feet (305 meters). The standard temperature
          drops to about 32 F (0 C) at about 7,500 feet (2,300
          meters).</p><a name=
          "standardized instrument cluster"></a>

          <p><strong>standardized instrument cluster</strong><br>
          An industry-accepted standard for arranging the six
          most-commonly used flight instruments on an aircraft
          instrument panel. The instruments are arranged in two
          rows. The top row contains the airspeed indicator,
          attitude indicator, and altimeter. The bottom row
          contains the turn coordinator, heading indicator, and
          vertical speed indicator.</p><a name=
          "stationary front"></a>

          <p><strong>stationary front</strong><br>
          A front in which neither air mass is replacing the other.
          In such cases, the surface winds tend to blow parallel to
          the frontal zone. The slope of a stationary front is
          normally shallow, although it may be steep, depending on
          wind distribution and density difference.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>statute mile (sm)</strong><br>
          A distance of 5,280 feet (1,609 meters). In the United
          States, statute miles are used to measure visibility in
          weather reports. Speeds and distances are measured and
          reported in nautical miles (6,076 feet or 1,852 meters)
          or nautical miles per hour (knots).</p><a name=
          "steady-state flight"></a>

          <p><strong>steady-state flight</strong><br>
          Flight in which the opposing pairs of forces (lift and
          weight, thrust and drag) are balanced. An aircraft is
          considered to be in steady-state flight when it flies at
          a constant altitude and airspeed, or when it flies at a
          constant airspeed and is climbing or descending at a
          constant rate.</p><a name="steam fog"></a>

          <p><strong>stick</strong><br>
          A tubular control in some aircraft, usually between the
          pilot&#8217;s knees, used to control the aircraft about
          its roll and pitch axis (the same function as a
          yoke).</p><a name="stick shaker"></a>

          <p><strong>stick shaker</strong><br>
          A mechanism that shakes the control column in some

          "straight-and-level flight"></a>

          <p><strong>straight-and-level flight</strong><br>
          One of the more difficult maneuvers to master. Like a
          balancing act, straight-and-level flight requires that
          you make smooth, small corrections to keep from wobbling
          all over the sky. To master straight-and-level flight,
          you must hold a constant altitude and hold a constant
          heading.</p><a name="stratiform"></a>

          <p><strong>stratiform</strong><br>
          Clouds with extensive horizontal development. Stratiform

          of small water droplets.</p><a name="stratocumulus"></a>

          <p><strong>stratocumulus</strong><br>
          A low, predominantly stratiform cloud. It is usually a
          mosaic of gray and whitish patches or layers. The layers
          may or may not merge, and such clouds are rounded or
          roll-shaped with relatively flat tops.</p><a name=
          "stratosphere"></a>

          <p><strong>stratosphere</strong><br>
          The region of the earth's atmosphere above the
          troposphere and tropopause, beginning at an altitude of
          5&#8211;10 mi (8&#8211;16 km), depending on latitude and
          season. The stratosphere is a region of relatively
          uniform temperatures and winds, extending to about 30
          miles (48 kilometers), where it meets the
          mesosphere.</p><a name="stratus clouds"></a>

          <p><strong>stratus clouds</strong><br>
          A low, gray cloud layer or sheet with a fairly uniform
          base formed in stable air. Stratus clouds sometimes
          appear in ragged patches. They seldom produce
          precipitation, but may produce drizzle or snow
          grains.</p><a name="student pilot certificate"></a>

          <p><strong>student pilot certificate</strong><br>
          In the United States, a pilot certificate issued to a
          pilot in training. To be eligible for a student pilot
          certificate for powered aircraft, a person must be at
          least 16 years old and hold at least a current
          third-class medical certificate. A student pilot
          certificate is valid for 24 months. Student pilots cannot
          carry passengers, act as pilot in command of an aircraft
          for compensation or hire, or make international flights
          (except between certain places in Alaska and Canada).
          Student pilots can fly only when visibility is at least 3
          sm (5 sm at night) and must maintain visual contact with
          the ground. Student pilots also must receive specific
          endorsements from a certified flight instructor before
          flying solo, making cross-country flights, or operating
          an aircraft in certain types of controlled airspace.
          Those endorsements must be renewed every 90
          days.</p><a name="sublimation"></a>

          <p><strong>sublimation</strong><br>
          The changing of ice directly to water vapor, or water
          vapor to ice, bypassing the liquid state in each process.
          Snow or ice crystals result from the sublimation of water
          vapor directly to the solid state.</p><a name=

          1.</p><a name="supercharger"></a>

          <p><strong>supercharger</strong><br>
          A compressor used to increase the density of the air or
          the air-fuel mixture supplied to a piston engine. As an
          aircraft climbs, the density of the air entering the
          engine decreases. Without a supercharger or a
          turbocharger, an engine gradually loses power. A normally
          aspirated, or &quot;unboosted,&quot; engine is most efficient at
          about 8,000 feet (2,438 meters). By the time an aircraft
          reaches 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), the density of the
          air is about half its value at sea level, and a
          supercharger or turbocharger is required for efficient
          operation of the engine.</p><a name=
          "supercooled water"></a>

          <p><strong>supercooled water</strong><br>
          Water droplets colder than 0 C (32 F). When supercooled
          droplets strike an exposed object, such as an aircraft's
          wings and other structures, the impact induces freezing.
          Supercooled water droplets often are in abundance in
          clouds at temperatures between 0 and &#8211;15 C with
          decreasing amounts at colder temperatures. However,
          strong vertical currents may carry supercooled water to
          great heights where temperatures are much colder.
          Supercooled water has been observed at temperatures
          colder than &#8211;40 C.</p><a name="supersonic"></a>

          <p><strong>synchrophaser</strong><br>
          A device that automatically adjusts the speed of the
          propellers of all engines on a multiengine aircraft so
          that a master blade on each propeller keeps the same
          relative position in its rotation to the master blade of
          each of the other propellers.</p>

          <p>Propellers out of synch result in higher cabin-noise
          levels and a sort of washing-machine-like sound. During
          World War II, pilots flying with their props out of synch
          earned the nickname &quot;Washing Machine Charlie.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>taildragger</strong><br>
          An aircraft that has its main wheels mounted ahead of the
          center of gravity and a small pivoting or steerable wheel
          supporting the aft fuselage. There is no nosewheel, as
          with tricycle-gear aircraft. Taildraggers were the norm
          during the early years of aviation and are sometimes
          referred to as conventional-gear aircraft. They are
          trickier to handle on the ground than tricycle-gear
          aircraft and require special training and

          <p><strong>temperature layer</strong><br>
          In Flight Simulator, a user-specified weather option that
          includes the air temperature at a specific altitude and
          the day-night variation in temperature. You select
          temperature options in the Advanced Weather dialog box.
          You can create four temperature layers to see how
          temperature affects density altitude and aircraft
          performance.</p><a name=
          "temperature-dew point spread"></a>

          <p><strong>temperature-dew point spread</strong><br>
          The difference between air temperature and dew point
          temperature. As this difference narrows, clouds and fog
          are more likely to appear. Pilots must also be aware that
          even if the spread at ground level is quite large, as
          temperature drops with altitude, the spread narrows, and
          clouds may form. Pilots should be especially alert for
          fog whenever the temperature-dew point spread is 5 F (2.8
          C) or less and decreasing.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>threshold</strong><br>
          The beginning of the runway surface that is usable for
          landings. The threshold may coincide with the physical
          end of the runway or be displaced if part of the runway
          is not usable for landings. The threshold is marked by a
          single white line on visual runways or by eight parallel
          white lines arranged in two groups of four on either side
          of the centerline of an instrument runway.</p><a name=

          <p><strong>throttle</strong><br>
          The cockpit control that most directly determines the
          power output of the engine. In a piston engine, the
          throttle actually controls the amount of air entering the
          carburetor or induction system. The carburetor, or fuel
          metering system, mixes the appropriate amount of fuel
          with the air to create a combustible mixture. When fully
          &quot;open,&quot; the throttle allows the maximum amount of air to
          enter the system to produce maximum power. When the
          throttle is &quot;closed,&quot; only a small amount of air enters
          the system and the engine produces minimum
          power.</p><a name="thrust"></a>

          <p><strong>thrust</strong><br>
          The forward force generated by a propeller or jet engine

          <p><strong>traffic pattern</strong><br>
          The traffic flow prescribed for aircraft landing at and
          taking off from an airport. Also called a &quot;circuit&quot; in
          Britain. A complete landing pattern includes a downwind
          leg, a base leg, and a final leg. Aircraft taking off
          typically fly an upwind leg and crosswind leg to depart
          the airport traffic pattern.</p><a name="trainer"></a>

          <p><strong>trainer</strong><br>
          Aircraft used for pilot training. They are usually (not

          pilot training include the Cessna 152, 172, and
          182.</p><a name="transmissometer"></a>

          <p><strong>transmissometer</strong><br>
          An instrument system that measures the transmission of
          light through the atmosphere. The transmission value is
          converted either automatically or manually into
          visibility, runway visual range (RVR), or

          <p><strong>transonic</strong><br>
          Speeds close to the speed of sound in which both subsonic

          range from about Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.4.</p><a name=
          "transponder"></a>

          <p><strong>transponder</strong><br>
          An airborne transceiver that receives signals from air
          traffic control (ATC) radar and replies with a preset
          identification code, or &quot;squawk,&quot; set by the pilot. A
          computer uses the code to display information about each
          aircraft on an air traffic controller's radar display.
          Most aircraft today are also equipped with altitude
          encoders, which transmit the aircraft's altitude along
          with the transponder code. In the United States, aircraft
          operating under visual flight rules (VFR) squawk code
          1200 unless they are using air traffic control services
          and are assigned a specific code by ATC. Under instrument
          flight rules (IFR), all aircraft are assigned transponder
          codes by ATC.</p><a name="transverse flow effect"></a>

          <p><strong>transverse flow effect</strong><br>
          A decrease in lift in the aft portion of a helicopter
          rotor disk when in forward flight or hovering in a
          wind.</p><a name="tricycle-gear"></a>

          <p><strong>tricycle-gear</strong><br>
          A landing gear system that includes a nosewheel assembly
          and two main gear assemblies. Because the center of
          gravity of a tricycle-gear airplane lies ahead of the
          main gear, this geometry is much more stable on the
          ground than the so-called conventional gear or
          &quot;taildragger&quot; arrangement, which has two main gear
          assemblies and a tailwheel.</p><a name="trim"></a>

          <p><strong>trim</strong><br>
          To adjust a movable tab on a control surface, usually the
          elevator, to relieve pressure on the flight controls.
          Trim is necessary because as an aircraft changes speed,
          the amount of air flowing over the control surfaces
          varies. Without trim, a pilot would have to hold forward
          or back pressure on the yoke or column to maintain a
          specific airspeed or pitch attitude. Larger aircraft also
          have aileron and rudder trim.</p><a name=
          "tropopause"></a>

          <p><strong>tropopause</strong><br>
          A thin layer in the upper atmosphere that forms the
          boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. The
          tropopause is usually characterized by an abrupt change
          in lapse rate. The height of the tropopause varies from
          about 65,000 feet (19.8 kilometers) over the equator to
          20,000 feet (6,096 meters) or lower over the poles.
          Temperature and wind vary greatly in the vicinity of the
          tropopause. Maximum winds generally occur at levels near
          the tropopause. These strong winds create narrow zones of
          wind shear, which often generate hazardous high-altitude
          turbulence.</p><a name="troposphere"></a>

          <p><strong>troposphere</strong><br>
          The layer of the atmosphere from the surface to an
          average altitude of about 7 miles (11 kilometers). Most
          weather occurs within the troposphere. Temperature
          generally decreases with altitude in the troposphere at
          an average rate of 2 C (3.6 F) per 1,000 feet (305
          meters). The height of the troposphere varies with
          latitude and seasons. It slopes from about 20,000 feet
          (6,096 meters) over the poles to about 65,000 feet (19.8
          kilometers) over the equator. It is higher in summer than
          in winter. A very thin layer called the tropopause marks
          the boundary between the troposphere and the next highest
          layer, the stratosphere.</p><a name="trough"></a>

          <p><strong>trough</strong><br>
          In meteorology, an elongated area of relatively low
          atmospheric pressure. A trough is usually associated with
          and most clearly identified as an area of maximum
          cyclonic curvature of the wind flow.</p><a name=
          "true airspeed"></a>

          <p><strong>true airspeed (TAS)</strong><br>
          An aircraft's actual speed through the surrounding air.
          As an aircraft climbs, the surrounding air becomes less
          dense. Therefore, indicated airspeed tends to decrease as
          altitude increases. To determine how fast the airplane is
          really moving through the air, the pilot calculates TAS
          based on the aircraft's current pressure altitude and the
          outside air temperature. A pilot must know TAS to solve
          navigation problems and file flight plans. As a rule of
          thumb, at a given indicated airspeed, true airspeed
          increases about 2 percent for each 1,000 feet (305
          meters) of altitude. Therefore, an aircraft flying at an
          indicated airspeed of 100 knots at 10,000 feet (3,050
          meters) is actually flying at about 120 knots through the
          air.</p><a name="true altitude"></a>

          <p><strong>true altitude</strong><br>
          An aircraft's actual height above mean sea level. True
          altitude is the altitude shown on the altimeter,
          corrected for nonstandard temperature. If the temperature
          at a particular indicated altitude is warmer than the
          standard temperature for that altitude, an aircraft's
          altimeter senses higher-than-normal pressure and shows an
          altitude lower than the aircraft is actually flying. If
          the temperature is cooler than the standard temperature
          for a particular altitude, the altimeter senses
          lower-than-normal pressure and shows an altitude higher
          than the aircraft is actually flying. Variations from
          nonstandard temperature usually cause only small errors
          in the altimeter. When flying without visual references
          over mountainous terrain, however, or when temperatures
          aloft differ significantly from the standard
          temperatures, a pilot should check the aircraft's true
          altitude to ensure obstacle clearance.</p><a name=
          "true north"></a>

          <p><strong>true north</strong><br>
          A heading, or course, pointed directly at the earth's
          geographic North Pole. The earth's magnetic North Pole is
          offset from the geographic North Pole, so course lines
          drawn on a chart are usually referenced to lines of
          longitude, which indicate true north. To solve navigation
          problems, pilots convert true courses, or headings, into
          magnetic courses and headings that they can fly by
          referencing the aircraft's compass. The difference
          between true north and magnetic north is called
          &quot;variation.&quot; The actual value of the variation depends on
          your location. Many weather reports and forecasts
          indicate wind direction in reference to true
          north.</p><a name="turbine"></a>

          <p><strong>turbine</strong><br>
          The fan-like portion of a jet engine or turboprop engine
          that compresses the incoming air.</p><a name=
          "turbine inlet temperature"></a>

          <p><strong>turbine inlet temperature (TIT)</strong><br>
          Air temperature measured as it enters the turbine inlet
          guide-vanes or the first stage of a turbocharger or a
          turbine engine. TIT is the highest temperature inside a
          turbocharged engine and is a limiting factor of the
          amount of power an engine can produce.</p><a name=
          "turbocharger"></a>

          <p><strong>turbocharger</strong><br>
          A device on a piston engine that compresses the air
          entering the engine to maintain power output at high
          altitudes. Exhaust gas from the engine spins a turbine in
          the turbocharger at high speed. A compressor attached to
          the same shaft as the turbine compresses the air entering
          the intake manifold, &quot;boosting&quot; the engine's power as the
          density of the outside air decreases with altitude.
          Turbochargers increase the temperature of the air
          entering the engine, so pilots must monitor engine
          temperatures carefully.</p><a name="turbofan"></a>

          <p><strong>turbofan</strong><br>
          A jet engine in which most of the air entering the engine
          is accelerated by a large fan and does not pass through
          the combustion chamber of the engine. Turbofan engines
          have largely replaced turbojet engines, in which most of
          the air entering the engine passes through the combustion
          chamber. Turbofan engines are much more efficient and
          significantly quieter than turbojets.</p><a name=
          "turbojet"></a>

          <p><strong>turbojet</strong><br>
          A jet engine in which most of the air entering the engine
          passes through several compressing turbines and then
          enters the combustion chamber. In a turbojet engine, the
          exhaust stream produces most of the engine's thrust.
          Turbojet engines have largely been replaced by more
          efficient and quieter turbofan engines.</p><a name=
          "turboprop"></a>

          <p><strong>turboprop</strong><br>
          A jet engine that drives a propeller to create thrust.
          Turboprop aircraft are less noisy and burn less fuel than
          turbojet aircraft, but they are also efficient only at

          certificate that permits a person to act as pilot in
          command of a specific type of aircraft, usually a heavy,
          turbojet-powered, or rotary wing aircraft. Type ratings
          are required for all aircraft with a maximum certified
          takeoff weight of more than 12,500 pounds (5,670
          kilograms) and all turbojet-powered aircraft, regardless
          of maximum takeoff weight. A type rating is also required
          to act as pilot in command of a helicopter if the

          <p><strong>uncoordinated flight</strong><br>
          Slipping or skidding flight caused by yawing forces
          produced by a turn, by the action of the propeller and
          slipstream, or by an imbalance of power in a multiengine
          aircraft. The inclinometer (ball) of the turn coordinator
          shows whether the yawing forces are properly balanced. If
          the ball is on the inside of a turn, the airplane is

          descent, usually in feet per minute. Also known as the
          rate of climb indicator (RCI) or vertical velocity
          indicator (VVI). Large aircraft are typically equipped
          with a sophisticated version of this instrument, called

          <p><strong>vertigo</strong><br>
          A state of temporary spatial confusion resulting from
          misleading information sent to the brain by various
          sensory organs; also called &quot;spatial disorientation.&quot;
          Vertigo typically occurs when a pilot cannot see the
          ground or other references due to clouds or darkness.
          Turns and other maneuvers can cause the vestibular
          system&#8212;a set of tubes and other sensory organs in
          the inner ear&#8212;to send conflicting signals about the
          aircraft's orientation and movement. Without visual
          references to overcome those sensations, the pilot
          quickly becomes disoriented and unable to tell whether
          the airplane is flying straight and level, turning,
          climbing, or descending. To avoid or overcome vertigo, a
          pilot must rely on the flight instruments to verify the
          aircraft's attitude and maintain control.</p><a name=

          is able to operate at a safe altitude that is at least
          500 ft (152 meters) below and 1,000 feet (304 meters)
          above any clouds. In addition, the pilot must remain at
          least 2,000 feet (608 meters) horizontally from any

          <p><strong>vortices</strong><br>
          Rotating air currents created by wings and other airfoils
          that are producing lift. Vortices are typically created
          when high-pressure air below a wing circulates toward the
          low-pressure area above a wing. These vortices are the
          primary source of induced drag, a by-product of lift.
          Vortices created by large, heavy aircraft (called &quot;wake

          <p><strong>weathervane effect</strong><br>
          The tendency of an aircraft to pivot around its center of
          gravity and point into the wind.</p><a name="weight"></a>

          <p><strong>weight</strong><br>
          One of the four basic forces at work on an aircraft in
          flight. Lift opposes weight (more accurately, the sum of
          all downward forces), which always acts directly toward
          the center of the earth. In most calculations,
          aeronautical engineers assume that all of an aircraft's
          weight is concentrated at a point called the center of
          gravity.</p><a name="wet wing"></a>

          <p><strong>wet wing</strong><br>
          An aircraft wing in which fuel is stored directly inside
          the skin of the wing as opposed to enclosing the fuel in
          a rubber bladder inside the wing.</p><a name=
          "Whitcomb, Richard"></a>

          <p><strong>Whitcomb, Richard</strong><br>
          1921&#8211; American engineer. At the laboratory of the
          National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA),
          Whitcomb developed the &quot;area rule&quot; for reducing drag at
          transonic speeds by pinching the fuselage where it meets
          the wing. In 1955, he won aviation's prestigious Collier
          Trophy for inventing this &quot;Coke-bottle effect&quot; during his
          breakthrough redesign of the fuselage of the Convair
          YF-102.</p><a name="Whittle, Frank"></a>

          <p><strong>Whittle, Frank</strong><br>
          1907&#8211;1996. English engineer and RAF officer who
          invented the turbojet aircraft engine. Whittle published
          his theory of jet propulsion in 1928, but the British Air
          Ministry didn't become interested in the idea until 1938.
          Whittle developed a working jet aircraft by 1941;
          however, it wasn't until 1944 that the first military jet
          aircraft, the Gloster Meteor, was put into
          service.</p><a name="wilco"></a>

          <p><strong>wind layer</strong><br>
          In Flight Simulator, a user-specified weather option that
          includes wind speed, direction, gust factor, and
          turbulence between two altitudes. You select these
          options on the Wind tab in the Advanced Weather dialog
          box. You can create two wind layers in each weather
          area.</p><a name="wind shear"></a>

          <p><strong>wind shear</strong><br>
          A sudden, sharp change in wind direction or speed, often
          associated with a violent, downward burst of air called a
          microburst or a low-level temperature inversion. Wind
          shear is particularly dangerous to aircraft during
          takeoff and landing, where it can cause large variations
          in airspeed and lead to a rate of sink that can push an
          aircraft into the ground.</p><a name="wind tunnel"></a>

          <p><strong>wind tunnel</strong><br>
          A device for studying the effects of airflow on aircraft
          and other vehicles or structures. To simulate the
          conditions of flight, an aircraft model is mounted in the
          tunnel and subjected to a stream of air. Sensors gather
          data on lift and drag, pressure, and other forces acting
          on the model.</p><a name="wing loading"></a>

          <p><strong>wing loading</strong><br>
          An aircraft's weight divided by the area of its wings.
          For example, an aircraft weighing 4,000 pounds (1,814
          kilograms) that has 400 square feet of wing area has a
          wing loading of 10 pounds per square foot.</p><a name=
          "winglets"></a>

          <p><strong>winglets</strong><br>
          Vertical extensions added to the ends of a main wing.
          Winglets reduce induced drag by increasing the effective
          aspect ratio of the wing, thereby decreasing the
          intensity of wingtip vortices produced as a by-product of
          lift.</p><a name="wingspan"></a>

          <p><strong>wingspan</strong><br>
          The distance from one wing tip to the other.</p><a name=
          "wingtip vortex"></a>

          <p><strong>wingtip vortex</strong><br>
          Rapidly rotating air at an aircraft's wing tips created
          when a wing produces lift. At the tips, high-pressure air
          below the wing spirals up to the low-pressure area above
          the wing. Large, heavy aircraft produce intense vortices
          that are extremely hazardous to small aircraft,
          especially during takeoff and landing. For example, a
          small aircraft that flies into a wingtip vortex can be
          rolled inverted because the rotation of the vortex
          exceeds the rolling capability produced by the ailerons.
          Also known as &quot;wake turbulence.&quot;</p><a name=

          <p><strong>Wright brothers</strong><br>
          American aviation pioneers Wilbur (1867&#8211;1912) and
          Orville (1871&#8211;1948) Wright made the first powered
          flight in a heavier-than-air craft. They began
          experimenting with double-winged kites and gliders, and
          in 1900, made their first test flights at Kitty Hawk. In
          1901, they built the first wind tunnel in the United
          States, testing over 200 models of wing surfaces. After
          building an engine for their Flyer, they made their
          historic flight on December 17, 1903.</p>

          <p><strong>yaw</strong><br>
          Movement of an aircraft about its vertical axis, as when
          the nose turns left or right. Along with roll and pitch,
          yaw is one of an airplane's three basic movements. The
          vertical stabilizer and rudder are designed to control
          yaw.</p><a name="Yeager, Chuck"></a>

          1923&#8211; American Air Force officer and fighter pilot,
          test pilot, and the first person to fly faster than the
          speed of sound (1947). Yeager, who achieved the rank of
          brigadier general in 1968, received numerous decorations,
          including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Purple
          Heart, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Yeager made
          his most famous flight despite two broken ribs he
          sustained in a riding accident just days

          <p><strong>zeppelin</strong><br>
          An airship with rigid internal bracing. The helium or
          hydrogen used to lift a zeppelin is usually contained in
          large cells. The largest of airships, zeppelins were used
          as bombers in World War I, but they caused little damage;
          instead, most were lost to accidents and enemy fire. In
          1937, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster brought a swift end to
          the use of the rigid airship as a civil
          transport.</p><a name=

          general who rode in observation balloons with Union
          forces during the American Civil War. In 1898, he founded
          an airship factory in Germany and constructed the first
          rigid type of airship. By 1910, his zeppelins carried
          passengers on excursions between German cities, and in
          1912, the German navy ordered the first military
          zeppelin.</p><a name="Zulu time"></a>
