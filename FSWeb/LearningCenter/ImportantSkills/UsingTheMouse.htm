          <div class="article-bodycopy">
            <p>We've expanded the usefulness of the mouse in Flight
            Simulator, bringing back a feature that many users
            liked in older versions: using the
            mouse as a control device for flying. The mouse is also in many
            cases the best device for setting instruments, changing
            radio frequencies, and other cockpit chores.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Using the Mouse to Fly</p>

            <p>Flying with the mouse is easier than using
            the arrow keys on the keyboard, which is great if you don't
            own a joystick, yoke, or other controller.</p>
			
			<p>Once you active the mouse as a flight control device (see below):
			<ul>
			<li>move the mouse right to go right,</li>
			<li>move the mouse left to go left,</li>
			<li>move the mouse toward you to go up,</li>
			<li>and move the mouse away from you to go down.</li>
			</p>
		
            <p><strong>Use a VERY light touch and small control movements
			when using the mouse to fly the aircraft.</strong></p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Mouse as a Cockpit Tool</p>

            <p>The mouse can be a Flight Simulator pilot's best
            copilot, acting as the hand that flicks switches,
            resets the altimeter, moves the GPS display within
            view, and helps you scroll through your flight notes.
            Just click the control you want to operate. Some
            controls act like toggle switches: for example,
            clicking the landing gear lever once retracts the
            wheels; clicking it again extends them. Other controls,
            such as the throttle and trim wheel, move through a
            series of positions. You can drag these controls using
            the mouse, much as you would move them using your hand
            in a real airplane.</p>



            <p class="SubHead">Using the Mouse Wheel</p>

            <p>If you have a mouse with a wheel on it, you can use
            it to manipulate many cockpit controls, such as
            adjustment knobs and the trim wheel. Move the pointer
            over the control until the pointer changes to a hand,
            and then roll the mouse wheel to change the
            control.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Rollover Descriptions</p>

            <p>You can discover each gauge's function by simply 
            rolling over it with the mouse without clicking; a
            description will pop up.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Toggle Switches</p>

            <p><img src="images/UsingTheMouse01.jpg" width="167"
            height="57" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>To flip toggle switches, position the mouse over the
            switch you wish to change and then click. Since toggles only
            have two positions, clicking a second time on the same
            switch returns it to its original position.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Adjustment Knobs</p>

            <p><img src="images/UsingTheMouse02.jpg" width="336"
            height="52" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Many of the cockpit gauges, such as the altimeter
            and heading indicator, have adjustment knobs, which
            should be adjusted prior to and during flight. Other
            instruments, such as the VOR OBS knob, should be
            adjusted during flight.</p>

            <p>To turn knobs, position your pointer over the
            instrument's control knob. When the pointer sits on
            either side of the knob, a hand cursor
            appears.</p><img src=
            "images/UsingTheMouse_upcursor.gif" width="88" height=
            "74" alt="" border="0"> <img src=
            "images/UsingTheMouse_dncursor.gif" width="88" height=
            "74" alt="" border="0">

            <p>When the hand with the minus sign (-) appears,
            clicking will reduce the instrument's setting; the
            opposite is true when the plus sign (+) hand appears.
            If you click and hold the knob, the instrument's
            control knob will begin to rotate in the direction
            indicated. Release the mouse when the knob reaches the
            desired setting.</p>

            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You can also use the mouse wheel to
            turn the adjustment knobs. Move the pointer over the
            control until the pointer changes to a hand, and then
            roll the mouse wheel to change the control.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Dragging</p>

            <p><img src="images/UsingTheMouse03.jpg" width="118"
            height="71" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Some controls&#8212;such as the throttle, trim
            wheel, and mixture&#8212;can be pulled using the mouse.
            First move the pointer over the desired control, then
            click and hold while dragging.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Control Panel</p>

            <p><img src="images/UsingTheMouse04.jpg" width="153"
            height="25" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Control panel icons offer an easy way to access
            flight maps, the GPS receiver, and other instruments
            located outside the screen frame. Familiarize yourself
            with their functions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>To display or hide the Kneeboard, click the
              <img src="images/UsingTheMouseKneeboard.jpg" width=

              <img src="images/UsingTheMouseMap.jpg" width="15"
              height="14" alt="" border="0"> icon. Viewing the
              flight map will pause the simulation. To hide the
              map, click <strong>Cancel</strong> or <strong>OK</strong> at the bottom
              of the map.</li>

              <li>To display or hide the GPS, click the <img src=

              alt="" border="0"> icon.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some aircraft also have throttle control icons,
            ceiling panel icons, and flap lever panel icons; these
            icons will also appear on the control panel. Roll over
            the icons to read what each represents, then click on
            the items that you wish to display or hide.</p>

            <p>In this version of Flight Simulator, the mouse works
            in the 3D Virtual Cockpit just as it works in the
            two-dimensional Cockpit View. Use your joystick's hat
            switch or your keyboard's numeric keypad to display the
            panel you want, then use the mouse as described
            above.</p>
