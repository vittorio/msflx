            <p>There is a great deal of custom scenery available on
            the Internet, created by third parties. You can use the
            Scenery Library to find, add, delete, and organize
            scenery, or to add, delete, or modify the cache of the
            scenery files that load from the CD as you fly between
            scenery areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> During setup, Flight Simulator installs
            default scenery into the proper directories and
            organizes it into appropriate areas and layers. Before
            you use the Scenery Library, make sure that you read
            and understand all the topics in this article. If you
            accidentally delete scenery areas or reorganize scenery
            areas improperly, you may need to reinstall Flight
            Simulator to restore the proper settings.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">How Flight Simulator Organizes
            Scenery</p>

            <p>To display the proper level of detail as you fly
            throughout the Flight Simulator world, it's important
            that your scenery is organized into the correct areas
            and layers.</p>

            <p>Each scenery area is associated with a layer,
            ordered by priority. Layer 1 has the highest priority;
            think of it as the top of the scenery stack. The
            specific layer number assigned to an area isn't as
            important as that area's relative position in the
            stack.</p>

            <p>Scenery areas vary in size and complexity. The lower
            an area's priority in the layer list, the larger the area
            generally is. For example, the Tokyo scenery area is
            smaller and more detailed than the Japan scenery area,
            so Tokyo is a higher-priority layer than Japan.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Arranging Scenery Areas</p>

            <p>You can rearrange scenery areas by assigning them to
            different layers. The concept to keep in mind when you
            place a new scenery area in the Scenery Library
            priority list is that it must have a higher priority (a
            lower number) than the default scenery upon which you
            want it to rest.</p>

            <p>In other words, if you add custom scenery for the
            Chicago area, you'll want that scenery area to be
            higher in the Scenery Library priority list than the
            Central North America scenery area.</p>

            <p>You may want to keep a scenery area on your hard
            drive but not have it appear in the simulator. To
            accomplish this, you must disable the scenery area in
            the Scenery Library. In order to manage one add-on
            scenery area separately from other add-on scenery, you
			must put it in its own folder in the <strong>C:\...\Microsoft Flight
            Simulator\Addon Scenery</strong> folder.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Adding Scenery Areas</p>

            <p>If you purchase or download additional compatible
            scenery, it's best to use the setup program that
            accompanies the software to install the scenery area.
            There are three ways to manually add scenery to Flight
            Simulator that doesn't include a setup program. The method 
			you use depends on whether or not
            you want to have the flexibility to manage the new
            scenery separately from other add-on scenery you may
            have installed.</p>

            <p>The new scenery should contain two folders: Scenery
            and Texture. After copying the add-on scenery and texture
            files into the folders named <strong>C:\...\Microsoft Flight
            Simulator\Addon Scenery\Scenery</strong> and
            <strong>C:\...\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Addon
            Scenery\Texture</strong>, the scenery will
            automatically load the next time you start Flight
            Simulator. Add-on scenery is automatically placed in a
            higher layer than default scenery, so that it will be
            visible.</p>

            <p>If you install the files in the folders named above,
            the new scenery area will not show up separately in the
            Scenery Library; it will be included in a group scenery
            area called <strong>Addon Scenery</strong>. If you install a lot
            of add-on scenery in this manner, you won't easily be
            able to tell what you've installed and you won't be
            able to disable or delete the new scenery without
            disabling or deleting <em>all</em> add-on scenery.</p>

            <p>If you want to have the flexibility to view the new
            scenery area separately in the Scenery Library and be
            able to manage it separately from other add-on
            scenery, create a separate folder for each new set of
            add-on scenery in the <strong>C:\...\Microsoft Flight
            Simulator\Addon Scenery</strong> folder.</p>
