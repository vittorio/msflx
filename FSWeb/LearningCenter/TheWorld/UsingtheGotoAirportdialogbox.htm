            <p>Many Flight Simulator pilots get a kick out of
            flying out of their home airport, or flying out of a
            famous airport on the other side of the world. With
            more than 23,000 airports to choose from, it's
            surprisingly easy to place your airplane at any one of
            them without flying a single mile.</p>

            difficult; the Go to Airport dialog box includes tools
            to help you. You can search for an airport by name, ID,
            or city. You may not know the name or ID of the airport
            you're looking for, but you probably know the city.
            Even if you don't know the city, the dialog box
            includes filters to limit the number of names
            displayed.</p>

            <p>Let's find <strong>John F. Kennedy International
            Airport</strong> in New York City, New York, in the United
            States.</p>

            <p>If you know that the exact name of the airport (as
            it's listed in Flight Simulator) is <strong>Kennedy
            Intl</strong>, you can type &quot;Kennedy&quot; or &quot;Kennedy Intl&quot; in
            the <strong>Airport Name</strong> text box.</p>

            <p>If you don't know the exact airport name, but you
            know that the airport identifier is <strong>KJFK</strong>, you
            can type the ID into the <strong>Airport ID</strong> text
            box.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Airport City</strong> text box limits the list of
            airports to those in the city you're searching. If you
            don't know either the airport name or the ID, but you
            know the airport is in New York City, you can type the
            city name in the <strong>Airport City</strong> text box, and then
            look for Kennedy in the resulting list.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Filtering the Airport List</p>

            <p>Sometimes you may want to fly from an airport in a
            particular country, region, state, or province but you
            don't know any airport names, IDs, or city names. In
            this case, it would be easier to filter the airport
            list. A filter also helps in cases where you're not
            sure of the spelling of an airport or city name.</p>

            &quot;Saunier&quot; in the name.</p>

            <p>You can find an airport in a city that has Saunier
            in the name, somewhere in France. This is a typical
