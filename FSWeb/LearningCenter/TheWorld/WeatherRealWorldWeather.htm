            but it's clear in London, that's what you will see as
            you fly across the English Channel. You'll also see the
            actual current weather conditions at all points in
            between, and see the skies clearing before you as you
            fly.</p>

            conditions as they change in the real world. <strong>With
            this option, Flight Simulator initially downloads a
            snapshot of the weather for the entire world, and then
            downloads weather for an area of 50 kilometers around
            your current location every 15 minutes.</strong> As you fly,
            the weather updates every 15 minutes according to the
            reported weather at stations nearest your current
            position. (The weather will download more frequently if
            you fly 80 percent of the distance across the initial
            download area.)</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Weather stations in Flight Simulator are
                    located in the same places as real-world
                    weather stations. Real-world weather will only
                    be downloaded into those locations in Flight
                    Simulator. If there's no weather station in the
                    real world near your favorite airport, there's
                    no data to download to Flight Simulator.
                    Weather conditions will be interpolated between
                    the weather stations nearest your airport.</li>

                    <li>Real-world weather can only be gathered as
                    often as the real-world stations report. Some
                    stations report every 15 minutes, while others
                    report every hour or every few hours.</li>

                    <li>Flight Simulator real-world weather may be
                    slightly different from what other sources
                    (e.g., NOAA) report. Different weather services
                    may use a different reporting structure.</li>

                    <li>There are other limitations to the way that
                    weather information is gathered and reported.
                    For example, METARs do not provide information
                    about upper-level clouds if the lowest observed
                    ceiling is overcast. In that case, only the
                    lowest reported layer would be in the data
                    downloaded to Flight Simulator.</li>

                    <li>If you download <strong>Real-world weather</strong>
                    and then customize the conditions in
                    <strong>User-defined weather</strong>, the effects of the
                    real-world weather will be redistributed and
                    diluted to some degree. This doesn't mean you
                    shouldn't modify real-world weather, it just
                    means you should be aware that the results are
                    not entirely predictable.</li>
