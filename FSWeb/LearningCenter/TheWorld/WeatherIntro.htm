            <p>Weather is one of the most challenging elements of
            real-world flying. You often don't know exactly what
            conditions you'll find along the route or at your
            destination. You may break out of a thick cloud layer
            on an instrument approach only to confront a driving
            snowstorm, or you may breathe a sigh of relief as the
            clouds open up, allowing an easy visual approach.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator weather gives you the option of
            choosing preset weather conditions (<strong>Themes</strong>),
            downloading weather from the Web (<strong>Real-world
            weather</strong>), or specifying your own custom conditions
            (<strong>User-defined weather</strong>).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Weather Themes</p>

            <p>The easiest way to set weather in Flight Simulator
            is to choose one of the weather <strong>Themes</strong>. Themes
            are pre-built weather systems that are centered on the
            current location of your aircraft. To learn about using
            Themes, see <a href="WeatherThemes.htm">Using Weather
            Themes</a>.</p><a name="Dynamic Weather"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Dynamic Conditions</p>

            <p>When using the weather-rate slider on the
            <strong>Weather</strong> tab (in the Display Settings dialog box), 
			atmospheric conditions in Flight
            Simulator affect the formation or dissipation of
            clouds, the onset of precipitation, and the movement of
            frontal systems. For the first time, you can set
            time-changing conditions along your route, making
            clouds form and move across the sky with the wind. To
            learn more, see <a href="WeatherOptions.htm">Weather
            Settings</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Real-World Weather</p>

            <p>You can now have real-world data automatically
            updated every fifteen minutes as you fly! A greater
            variety of cloud types are created based on data
            downloaded from the Web, and turbulence is deduced from
            atmospheric conditions. To learn about using Real-world
            weather, see <a href=
            "WeatherRealWorldWeather.htm">Using Real-World
            Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Weather Dialog Box</p>

            <p>Think of the <strong>Weather</strong> dialog box as &quot;weather
            central,&quot; the place where you choose the method you'll
            use to create weather. <strong>Weather themes</strong> allow you
            to choose from prebuilt weather systems and offers a
            fast path to complex weather settings. <strong>Real-world
            weather</strong> downloads real-world weather from <a href=
            "../partners/Jeppesen.htm">Jeppesen</a>. User-defined
            weather brings up a secondary dialog box where you can
            select your own custom weather. You can use the
            User-Defined Weather dialog box to make quick, broad
            changes to weather conditions for specific weather
            stations, or for the entire world.</p>

            articles in the <strong>Related Links</strong> section at the top
            of this article.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Weather Stations in Flight
            Simulator</p>

            <p>In the real world, weather information is gathered
            by all kinds of measuring devices at weather stations.
            In Flight Simulator, the locations of the real-world
            weather stations are replicated, but instead of just
            reporting the weather there, Flight Simulator creates
            weather around those locations. In other words, if you
            select the weather station at London's Heathrow airport
            and change weather settings, the weather conditions
            that you set will only apply within an area of a few
            miles around Heathrow. If you select several stations
            around Heathrow and set those same weather conditions,
            the area in which the conditions appear becomes larger.
            You can set specific conditions at a specific weather
            station or group of stations, or set weather for all
            the stations in the world at one time. See <a href=
            "WeatherUserDefinedWeather.htm">Using User-Defined
            Weather</a> for detailed instructions on how to set
            custom weather conditions.</p>

            <p>The image below depicts the approximate distribution
            of weather stations around the world.</p>
