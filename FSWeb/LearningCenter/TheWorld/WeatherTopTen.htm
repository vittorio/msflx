            <p>With all of the new weather features, where do you
            start to explore? This list is a good place to
            begin.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">1. You can make weather in three
            different ways.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator includes three ways to create
            weather: Weather themes, Real-world weather, and
            User-defined weather. Which one should you choose?</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Choose <strong>Weather themes</strong> to quickly define
              complete weather systems centered on your aircraft's
              current position.</li>

              <li>Choose <strong>Real-world weather</strong> when you want to
              fly in the conditions that currently exist in the
              real world.</li>

              <li>Choose <strong>User-defined weather</strong> to have
              control over all of the weather variables.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For more information, see <a href=
            "WeatherIntro.htm">Introduction to Flight Simulator
            Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">2. Themes can quickly define complex
            weather conditions.</p>

            <p>Weather themes, a new feature in Flight Simulator,
            offer pre-constructed weather systems that you select
            from a list. Choose themes to set calm, sunny
            conditions, or to select violent, changing weather
            across your flight path. If you're looking for complex,
            challenging weather to fly in, a theme works much more
            quickly than setting all the weather parameters
            yourself.</p>

            <p>For more information, see <a href=
            "WeatherThemes.htm">Using Weather Themes</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">3. Weather appears around weather
            stations.</p>

            <p>The weather stations in Flight Simulator are located
            in the same places where they exist in the real world.
            In many cases, these stations are located on airports,
            but in some cases they are not. Very new weather
            stations may not yet be included in the Flight
            Simulator database.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that you don't need to go to a
            particular airport in order to change the weather
            conditions at that airport. Simply go to the map in the
            <strong>User-Defined Weather</strong> dialog box and find the
            weather station or stations nearest the location where
            you want to set the weather. Select that weather
            station (or multiple stations) and set the weather
            there without changing your current location. You can,
            of course, move the airplane and set the weather at
            that location if you prefer.</p>

            <p>To learn more about setting weather at specific
            stations or groups of stations, see <a href=
            "WeatherUserDefinedWeather.htm">User-defined
            Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">4. You can change weather
            dynamically.</p>

            <p>Whether you've chosen a <strong>Weather theme</strong>,
            <strong>Real-world weather</strong>, or <strong>User-defined
            weather</strong>, you can make the weather change
            dynamically over time. Based on the atmospheric
            conditions established for your flight, the weather
            will behave accordingly. For example, if there is a low
            pressure area, clouds will form.</p>

            <p>To learn more about dynamic weather changes, see
            <a href="WeatherOptions.htm">Weather Settings</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">5. You can change weather around
            multiple stations.</p>

            <p>For a number of reasons, you may want to set custom
            weather for more than one station at a time. You can do
            this in two ways:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Select more than one weather station on the map
              in the <strong>User-defined weather</strong> dialog box, and
              set custom weather for those stations as a
              group.</li>

              <li>Set weather at specific stations by defining
              weather separately for each station in the
              <strong>User-defined weather</strong> dialog box.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">6. Real-world weather comes from
            real-world weather stations.</p>

            <p>If you select <strong>Real-world weather</strong> but the
            weather outside your window looks different, remember
            that Flight Simulator weather stations are located in
            the same places as real-world weather stations.
            <strong>Real-world weather</strong> will only be downloaded into
            those locations in Flight Simulator. If there's no
            weather station in the real world near your favorite
            airport (or your house), there's no data to download to
            Flight Simulator. In this case, the weather you see at
            your location in Flight Simulator is mathematically
            estimated based on the data from the nearest weather
            stations.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator can only update Real-world weather
            as often as the real-world stations report. Some
            stations report every 15 minutes, while others report
            every hour or every few hours. Flight Simulator
            Real-world weather may be slightly off from what a
            different source reports (e.g., NOAA) if that weather
            service uses a different reporting structure.</p>

            <p>For more information, see <a href=
            "WeatherRealWorldWeather.htm">Using Real-World
            Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">7. You can create fog.</p>

            <p>Setting a cloud layer at ground level will not
            create fog-like conditions in Flight Simulator. The key
            to fog is reduced visibility. You can set visibility in
            <strong>User-defined weather</strong>, either from the
            <strong>Weather</strong> dialog box or the <strong>Advanced
            Weather</strong> dialog box.</p>

            <p>For more information, see <a href=
            "WeatherUserDefinedWeather.htm">User-defined
            Weather</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">8. Automated weather reports center
            on airports, not weather stations.</p>

            <p>If you choose a <strong>Weather theme</strong> while at your
            favorite airport, the ATIS/AWOS (automated weather
            report) may report the weather differently. Even if the
            theme you choose specifies weather conditions very
            close to the airport, ATIS and AWOS report the weather
            directly over the weather station. For example, if you
            choose the <strong>Cold Front</strong> theme, you may see clouds
            a short distance away from the airport and still hear
            the weather reported as &quot;no clouds below 20,000
            feet.&quot;</p>

            <p class="SubHead">9. Saving flights also saves your
            weather conditions.</p>

            <p>No matter which option you use to set weather, those
            conditions will be saved if you save a flight that has
            those weather conditions. Although you won't see the
            exact same clouds as when you saved the flight, the
            flight will have the same atmospheric conditions, cloud
            coverage, precipitation, etc.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">10. Precipitation's just a fancy
            word for rain and snow.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, precipitation refers to rain
            and snow. Choose <strong>Rain</strong> or <strong>Snow</strong> in the
            <strong>Precipitation</strong> box of the <strong>Advanced Weather</strong>
            dialog box, or download <strong>Real-world weather</strong> and
            fly to a location where you know it is currently
            raining or snowing.</p>
