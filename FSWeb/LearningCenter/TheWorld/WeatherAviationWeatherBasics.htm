            <p>Even novice pilots understand that weather affects a
            plane in flight very differently than it affects a car
            driving down the freeway. Although weather conditions
            can compromise your safety both in the air and on the
            road, the stakes are higher in flight because you can't
            pull over to the shoulder if the severity of weather
            exceeds your abilities.</p>

            <p>To better understand the forces that weather exerts
            on planes, it's important to realize that the
            atmosphere is not empty space. Heat from the sun and
            friction from the earth's surface act upon the gases
            and water in the air, creating a variety of weather
            conditions.</p>

            <p>A number of factors&#8212;wind, cloud layers,
            temperature, dew point, barometric pressure, and
            visibility&#8212;affect your Flight Simulator
            experience. You've probably heard your local weather
            forecaster use these terms, but as a pilot, it's
            important that you understand their precise
            meanings.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Wind</p>

            <p>Wind is one of the basic weather factors affecting
            flight. Depending on its severity, wind can be a
            nuisance&#8212;pushing you off course by affecting your
            heading, airspeed, or altitude&#8212;or a true hazard,
            creating dangerous flight conditions. Wind can also
            make takeoffs and landings more challenging if it's not
            aligned with the active runway. And, although it seems
            basic, remember that if you're flying into the wind,
            you're going to fly slower; flying with the wind will
            move you along faster.</p>

            <p>Friction on the ground acts as a kind of brake on
            the wind. Weather systems don't move in a straight line
            and often rotate, so wind in one area may not be
            blowing in the same direction as wind in another area
            nearby. Winds can also change quickly across a weather
            front. Because there can be dramatic differences
            between the direction and velocity of the wind on the
            ground and at high altitude, aviation weather reports
            include information on both surface winds and winds
            aloft.</p>

            <p>Wind shear refers to situations when the wind
            direction and speed are shifting rapidly over a short
            distance. Encountering wind shear on final approach to
            landing can add unwelcome excitement to your flight. If
            the wind shifts dramatically from a headwind to a
            tailwind, for example, you may experience severe
            downdrafts. Because a plane's airspeed is already
            relatively low on approach to landing, wind shear can
            create a dangerous situation.</p>

            <p>You also need to exercise care when taking off or
            landing in crosswinds, and you'll need to adjust your
            navigation if wind coming from one side blows you off
            track. If you're flying into a headwind, you'll need to
            keep fuel consumption in mind so that your plane
            doesn't run out of fuel before reaching your
            destination.</p>

            <p>Knowing the current conditions of winds aloft can
            help you plan your route and altitude to either take
            advantage of a tailwind or to avoid the worst of a
            headwind. Let's say the wind at an altitude of 15,000
            feet is blowing 360 degrees at 15 knots and the wind at
            25,000 feet is blowing 320 degrees at 30 knots. Assume
            for this example that your course for the flight is 340
            degrees.</p>

            <p>Assuming further that the aircraft you choose to fly
            performs well at either altitude, you might want to
            plan your flight for 25,000 feet, since you'll get a
            speed boost from a quartering tailwind (a quartering
            wind comes at you from 45 degrees off your tail or
            nose). If your course was 160 degrees, you might plan
            to fly at 15,000 feet to minimize the effect of a
            quartering headwind.</p>

            <p>When using the <strong>Real-world weather</strong> or
            <strong>Weather themes</strong> options in Flight Simulator's
            <strong>Weather</strong> dialog box (an option within the
            <strong>Free Flight</strong> dialog box), surface winds and
            winds aloft will be set for you. You can set surface
            winds and winds aloft yourself using the
            <strong>User-defined weather</strong> option.</p>

            <p>To learn how to set wind conditions, see <a href=
            "WeatherUserDefinedWeather.htm">User-defined
            Weather</a>.</p><a name="CloudTypes"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cloud Types</p>

            <p>Even to the most casual observer, scattered, puffy
            clouds are obviously different than solid overcast
            conditions. But there's more to it than simple scenery.
            Clouds vary in appearance due to the different
            atmospheric conditions that cause them to form.
            Understanding the conditions that create certain cloud
            types helps pilots determine what conditions they may
            encounter up ahead. Conversely, researching weather
            conditions ahead of time can give pilots an idea of
            what kinds of cloud layers to expect during flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Stratus</p>

            <p>Because the air in which stratus clouds form is
            relatively stable, stratus layers have a flat, even
            appearance and cover much of the sky.</p>

            <p>Although you will likely enjoy a smooth ride in
            these conditions, visibility is often less clear when
            the air is stable. Smoke, smog, and moisture can stay
            suspended in stable air, reducing visibility. (You can
            use the <strong>Visibility</strong> setting to determine the
            visibility distance; the type of cloud formations alone
            will not affect visibility.).</p>

            <p>Stratus clouds can be high and transparent, or low
            and dark gray. The lowest layers of stratus,
            nimbostratus clouds, are rain clouds. Higher,
            less-dense stratus layers can produce rain, but it
            tends to be more showery than the drizzle produced by
            low stratus layers.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Cumulus</p>

            <p>Cumulus clouds are the puffy, pretty ones.</p>

            <p><img src="images/WeatherAviationWeatherBasics01.jpg"
            width="159" height="89" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>They aren't, however, always benign. Cumulus clouds
            form in unstable air, which allows them to have greater
            vertical development than stratus clouds. Most
            frequently they have flat bases and lumpy tops, and
            form below 6,000 feet (1,828 meters). The more unstable
            the atmosphere, the higher cumulus can build.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Cumulonimbus</p>

            <p>Cumulonimbus clouds can tower to greater than 50,000
            feet (15,240 meters). Cumulonimbus are the clouds that
            make thunderstorms.</p>

            <p><img src="images/WeatherAviationWeatherBasics02.jpg"
            width="158" height="111" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Unstable atmosphere with rapidly rising masses of
            air creates the conditions necessary for thunder and
            lightning. Pilots should avoid these hazards whenever
            possible.</p>

            <p>Lightning strikes are actually not the most
            dangerous aspect of thunderstorms. Severe updrafts in a
            thunderstorm can overstress an aircraft's airframe, and
            violent hailstorms often associated with thunderclouds
            can cause damage to an aircraft's skin and
            windshield.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Squall Lines</p>

            <p>Thunderstorms can line up along a weather front,
            creating a squall line. Aircraft must navigate around
            squall lines, sometimes taking them hundreds of miles
            off their intended course. Flight Simulator will create
            squall lines if they currently exist when you click on
            the <strong>Real-world weather</strong> option in the
            <strong>Weather</strong> dialog box. If you want to create your
            own squall lines, you'll have to create thunderstorms
            along a line of weather stations by clicking on the
            <strong>Customize</strong> button under the <strong>User-defined
            weather</strong> option.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Cirrus</p>

            <p>Cirrus clouds are characterized by a wispy
            appearance and very high altitude. Cirrus are composed
            of ice crystals. Aircraft don't often fly at the
            extreme altitudes at which the cirrus reside.</p>

                  <p><strong>Quiz:</strong> On a flight from Dublin to Paris,
                  how would you create conditions so that you'd
                  have to take off into a low cloud layer, navigate
                  around thunderstorms near London, and break out
                  into the clear over Paris?</p>

                  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You could set a low stratus
                  layer at Dublin, create thunderstorms over
                  London, and then set cumulus clouds at 3/8
                  coverage at Paris. Once you'd set these
                  conditions for those stations, you could select
                  another type of weather and apply it to all other
                  weather stations in the world. That way, in
                  between the custom conditions you created, you'd
                  still have interesting weather to fly in.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Cold and Warm Fronts</p>

            <p>Cold fronts aren't necessarily cold. It's actually
            just the boundary between a mass of cold air and a mass
            of warm air in conditions where the cold air is moving
            in to replace the warm air. In the summer, the &quot;cold&quot;
            air is just cooler than the warm air and may not seem
            cold to you at all. Warm fronts are just the opposite;
            a warm air mass moving in to replace cooler air.</p>

            <p>Cold fronts are represented on weather maps such as
            those that you'll find in Flight Simulator's
            <strong>Weather</strong> dialog box as a blue line with triangles
            pointing in the direction the front is moving. Warm
            fronts are represented by red lines. You will only see
            fronts depicted on the map when you use <strong>Real-world

            <p>As a pilot, you need to be aware of how cold and
            warm fronts affect the conditions you'll be flying in.
            The cloud conditions and weather you'll encounter once
            the front passes depend on the stability and moisture
            content of the air mass the front is replacing.</p>

            <p>You won't create fronts using the <strong>User-defined
            weather</strong> option, but you'll see fronts (as well as
            high and low pressure areas) depicted on the weather
            map when using the <strong>Real-world weather</strong>
            option.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Pressure Changes</p>

            <p>Barometric pressure is important to pilots for two
            reasons: it affects how the plane's altimeter works and
            it affects the weather. In order to measure how high
            above sea level your aircraft is, its altimeter is set
            to local barometric pressure. When an air traffic
            controller says, &quot;Altimeter is 2992&quot; she's saying the
            local barometric pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury.
            She's also telling the pilot to set the Kollsman window
            of the altimeter to read 2992. The reading in feet or
            meters on the altimeter is known as pressure
            altitude.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Dew Point</p>

            <p>You really don't need to care about dew, unless
            you're sleeping under your airplane's wing. But when
            you're planning a flight you should care about the dew
            point&#8212;the temperature to which the air must be
            cooled to reach saturation.</p>

            <p>The air around us contains invisible moisture known
            as water vapor. The difference between a location's
            temperature and its dew point indicates how well the
            air can currently hold moisture. Because cool air has a
            harder time holding moisture than warm air, pilots use
            this information to determine how likely it is that
            fog, clouds, or precipitation will form.</p>

            <p>The temperature/dew point spread is usually given in
            terms of a percentage of <em>relative humidity</em>. For
            example, if the temperature is 72 F (22 C) and the dew
            point is 52 F (11 C), the relative humidity is 49
            percent. Using this example, the air is 49 percent
            saturated with moisture.</p>

            <p>When the air is cooled to a point where it reaches
            100 percent saturation, the water vapor condenses,
            forming clouds. If the temperature falls further, water
            drops form and fall to the ground as rain or, if it's
            cold enough, ice or snow. The presence of clouds does
            not guarantee precipitation, but the presence of
            precipitation guarantees there are clouds in the
            area.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, the <strong>Automated Terminal
            Information Service</strong> (ATIS) reports the current
            temperature and the dew point. The closer the dew point
            is to the current temperature, the more likely you're
            going to encounter clouds. If you're flying into an
            area where the temperature is 80 F (29 C) and the dew
            point is 65 F (18 C), you don't need to worry about a
            thick layer of clouds blanketing the area. If the
            temperature is 65 F and the dew point is 60 F (15 C),
            watch for clouds.</p>

            <p>You can set the temperature and dew point for any
            temperature layer in Flight Simulator. In practical
            terms, this means you can create conditions where it is
            more or less likely that clouds will form (although
            <strong>Precipitation</strong> is a separate setting within
            <strong>User-defined weather</strong>). Be aware that setting a
            low cloud layer in Flight Simulator weather will not
            constitute a layer of fog. To create fog-like
            conditions, modify the <strong>Visibility</strong> settings using
            the <strong>User-defined weather</strong> option.</p>

                  <p><strong>Quiz:</strong> If the temperature at your
                  destination is 85 F (29.4 C) and the dew point is
                  80 F (29 C), how likely is it that you'll see
                  clouds in the area when landing?</p>

                  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Very likely. Any time the
                  temperature/dew point spread is five degrees
                  Fahrenheit or less, the air has become
                  saturated.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Density Altitude</p>

            <p>Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for
            temperature. When the temperature is high, air is less
            dense. Density altitude affects aircraft performance:
            An increase in density altitude corresponds to a
            decrease in engine power output, propeller efficiency,
            and aerodynamic lift. Density altitude is normally
            computed using graphs in the pilot operating handbook
            for each aircraft, but for simplicity's sake, just be
            aware that if the weather is hot, your aircraft's
            performance will likely suffer. Turbine engine aircraft
            and turbocharged reciprocating engines suffer less, but
            density altitude is still a factor.</p><br clear="all">
