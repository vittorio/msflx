            <p>You expect Flight Simulator to offer thousands of airports,
			 rich scenery, and aircraft traffic. No matter where you fly 
			 throughout the Flight Simulator world, you find landmarks and 
			 locations that you have visited in real life or seen in photos 
			 or video. By expanding the simulated environment through 
			 animations and traffic, Flight Simulator offers new opportunities 
			 to create even more immersive adventures.</p>

            <p>Now, that immersive experience is even richer. With more traffic in
			the air, traffic on land and sea, and birds and animals, 
			 the Flight Simulator world is more alive than ever.</p>


            <p class="SubHead">Artificially Intelligent Aircraft</p>

            <p>The Flight Simulator world is populated with air traffic. 
			You can control the volume of traffic through a slider in 
			the Settings dialog box or set individual traffic settings on
			the <strong>Traffic</strong> tab of the Display Settings dialog box. To learn 
			more, see <a href="../Options/ChangingTrafficSettings.htm">
			Changing Traffic Settings</a></p>

			<p class="SubHead">Dynamic Airports</p>

            <p>In the past, the only things moving across airport runways 
			and terminal areas in Flight Simulator were aircraft. Now there are baggage 
			handlers, moving jetways, and ground traffic moving across the 
			airports&#8212;offering a new level of realism for airport operations.
			 To learn more, see <a href="../Options/ChangingTrafficSettings.htm">
			Changing Traffic Settings</a></p>			
			
			<img src="images/thelivingworld02.jpg">
			
			<p class="SubHead">Land and Sea Traffic</p>

            <p>With the <strong>Land and sea traffic</strong> settings, you can 
			adjust how many cars, trucks, and buses travel across 
			major roads and freeways. You can also adjust sea traffic, 
			even oceangoing ships, traversing the waterways and oceans you fly over.

			<p class="SubHead">Advanced Animations</p>

            <p>There are now birds and animals 
			moving around the Flight Simulator world. Advanced animations 
			also enable wings to flex in rough weather. To learn more about 
			enabling advanced animations, see the <strong>Global Options</strong>
			section of the <a href=
			"../Options/ChangingGraphicSettings.htm">Changing Graphic Settings<a/>
			article.</p>
