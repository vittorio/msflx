	  The way we navigate is changing. With GPS 
      and moving maps finding their way into our cockpits, our biggest concern

      all this stuff work?&quot; Here's the information you need to get the most out 
      of your equipment—whether you fly with a basic panel or an 
      approach-certified GPS. You'll see how pilotage, dead reckoning, and 
	  determining lines of position are still valuable to you, even if you fly
	   with the most modern equipment. Learn things you never knew about VORs, 
	   NDBs, and LORAN—and go beyond to fully explore the world of GPS, HSIs, RMIs,

      Add Safety to Your IFR Flights</strong><br>
 Like many pilots, you may have done your IFR training using 
      government charts, but you prefer to fly with Jeppesen charts because you 
      feel they offer you more information in a clearer fashion.<br>
      <strong>Important differences you should know</strong><br>
 But the problem is you've never had any training on how to read the 
      Jeppesen charts. And there are many differences in the way important 
      things are shown. For instance the minimums section of an approach chart 
      is entirely different in the Jeppesen version and can be confusing if you 
      don't know how the sections are organized. The profile view on Jeppesen 
      approach charts shows separate paths for ILS and localizer approaches, 
      while government charts show them as one. Jeppesen approach charts 
      sometimes show terrain, but do you know when?<br>
 Can you recognize the difference between the ways NDBs are 
      displayed on Jeppesen charts vs. government charts? How does each chart 
      type depict time zone boundaries, uncontrolled airspace, and airports? 
      How does each present MSA circles or ILS DMEs on a localizer frequency? 
      These are all shown differently and it can get pretty confusing
      Having the answers at your fingertips might easily affect the safety of 
      your IFR flight.<br>

 If you use Jeppesen Charts, or are considering switching to them, 
      you'll find King's Complete Jeppesen Chart Review course shows you the 
      differences between Jeppesen and NOS charts in clear and 
      easy-to-understand terms and makes your IFR flying easier and less 
      stressful. Volume One thoroughly covers the ins and outs of enroute, 
      departures &amp; arrivals; Volume Two explores approaches in-depth.<br>
      <strong>Created for pilots familiar with IFR procedures</strong><br>
 Each volume, created for pilots who are familiar with United States 
      IFR rules, presents a review of the meaning of the symbols used on the 
      charts—plus dozens of practical tips on how you can use the charts to 
      their fullest advantage.<br>
 Included in Enroute, Departures and Arrivals are how Jeppesen 
      depicts the alphabet soup of IFR altitudes (MEAs, etc.), and the 
      mysterious grid MORA. And even current IFR pilots may not be familiar with 
      some of the new concepts you'll find in the volume on Approaches. <em>135

       It's no secret, multi-engine aircraft are fast and they're fun. 
      With greater power, bigger size, and more levers, knobs, and dials, they 
      can deliver a thrill way beyond the pleasure of single-engine flight. But 
      we all know twins can be dangerous if the PIC isn't properly trained and 
      proficient.<br>
      <strong>Fly through the basic do's and don'ts</strong><br>
 In this video series, join John and Martha as you fly through the 
      do's and don'ts of safe multi-engine operation. John takes you into the 
      cockpit of a Duchess and gives memorable aerial demonstrations of the 
      basics of flight—and especially single-engine flight—in light twins.<br>
      <strong>Here's what you'll learn:</strong><br>
 You'll learn what a twin engine airplane can do on one engine—and 
      what it can't; how to maintain control while getting max performance on 
      one engine; and how to handle emergencies you might encounter (even a few 
      you may never have thought of). Multi-Engine Flying not only gives you the 
      basic skills for stepping up to multi-engine flight—it polishes your 
      airmanship and helps you make a seamless transition as you become the 
      master of the aircraft. <em>144 minutes.<br>
