                  <p>The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
                  (AOPA) is the largest and most influential
                  aviation organization in the world. It was
                  chartered in 1939 to keep general aviation fun,
                  safe, accessible, and affordable. Just what is
                  general aviation? Essentially, general aviation
                  encompasses all aviation activity except for
                  scheduled airlines and the military&#8212;an
                  incredible four out of every five aircraft
                  takeoffs in the United States each
                  day.</p><img src="images/AOPA.gif" width="250"

                  <p>AOPA's membership of some 408,000 pilots and
                  aircraft owners includes nearly two-thirds of all
                  U.S. pilots. The association has achieved its
                  prominent position through effective advocacy
                  (see <a href=
                  "http://www.aopa.org"
                  class="TopLink" target="_blank">AOPA's Web
                  site</a>), enlightened leadership, technical
                  competence, and hard work. It provides member
                  services that range from representation at the
                  federal, state, and local levels to world-class
                  publications, Web sites and e-mail newsletters,
