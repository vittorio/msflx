		<p>Welcome to your instructor in an audiobook. Written by veteran 
		ground and flight instructor Rod Machado, this audiobook is presented 
		in a warm, conversational manner and spiced with humor. Rod's tried 
		and true methods of instruction, honed through more than 30 years 
		of teaching experience, have achieved exceptional results with 
		thousands of aviation students. Now you can enjoy Rod’s popular 
		Private Pilot Handbook during your daily commute, or at home in the 
		comfort of your own chair. Play these CDs to learn or review important

		As one pilot said, “I felt like I had a flight instructor right there 
		in the car with me.” While you can listen to the first eight chapters 
		of the book without referring to the text, you’ll still want to use 
		the actual Private Pilot Handbook as a reference for reviewing pictures, 
		graphs and many of the incidental ASRS stories scattered throughout the 
		text. This exciting new CD is the key to learning faster and better, 
		while maximizing use of your scarce time. Don't waste a minute.

		  This wonderful 438-page hardbound book was written by
          44 pilots who are speakers with The Aviation Speakers
          Bureau. These funny, dramatic, and inspiring stories are
          some of aviation's finest tales. You would expect nothing
          less from aviation's celebrities, experts and
          specialists. Our flight plan takes us barnstorming in the U.S.,
          flying aerial combat missions in World War II and
          Vietnam, test-piloting new aircraft, performing air
          rescue, winging to exotic places, and flying to
          historically important aviation places from Kitty Hawk to
          the Moon. You will go along as history is being made and
          hear the pilot's perspective on some of these aviation
          firsts. You will find ACES and true heroes within these
          pages. <strong><em>Speaking of Flying</strong></em> is your ticket to adventure.
          Step aboard, and be prepared to laugh, cry, and feel the
          excitement. $19.95 <a href=         "http://www.microsoft.com/games/flightsimulator/product/fs2004_link_partner_machado2.asp"
