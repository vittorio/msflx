                  <p>Boeing has been the world leader in commercial
                  jetliners for more than 40 years. With the
                  McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997, Boeing's legacy
                  of leadership in commercial jets now is joined
                  with the lineage of Douglas airplanes, giving the
                  combined company a 70-year heritage of leadership
                  in commercial aviation. Today, the main
                  commercial products consist of the 717, 737, 747,
                  757, 767, and 777 families of airplanes, and the
                  Boeing Business Jet. New product development
                  efforts are focused on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a
                  super-efficient airplane that is expected to be
                  in service in 2008. The company has more than
                  14,000 commercial jetliners in service worldwide,
                  which is roughly 75 percent of the world
                  fleet.</p>

                  <p>Boeing continues to expand its product line
                  and develop new technologies to meet customer
                  needs. From creating new versions of its family
                  of commercial airplanes; to developing,
                  producing, supporting and modifying aircraft for
                  the U.S. military; to building launch vehicles
                  capable of lifting more than 14 tons into orbit;
                  to improving communications for people around the
                  world through an advanced network of satellites,
                  Boeing continues a long tradition of technical
                  excellence and innovation.</p>
