            <p>Flying rotary-wing aircraft is quite different from
            flying fixed-wing aircraft. Mastering helicopter flight
            will not only challenge you but will present some of
            the best flying experiences Flight Simulator has to
            offer. There's nothing like threading your way through
            the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago or New York, and
            with practice, you'll be able to make rooftop landings.
            For more information about the fundamentals of
            rotary-wing flight, see <a href=
            "../AdvancedFlyingSkills/FlyingHelicopters.htm">Flying
            Helicopters</a>.</p>

            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight under ISA
            conditions.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Controlling the Helicopter using a
            Joystick</p>

            <p>You can use a joystick to operate the basic flight
            and power controls for the Bell 206B JetRanger III
            helicopter.</p>

            <p>The stick part of the joystick controls the cyclic,
            which controls the helicopter's pitch attitude in
            flight and movement over the ground while in a
            hover.</p>

            <p>If you have a joystick like the Microsoft&#174;
            SideWinder 3-D Pro, you can twist the stick to apply
            left or right anti-torque pedal inputs. Anti-torque
            pedals are used to yaw the nose of a helicopter side to
            side by adjusting the pitch of the blades on the tail
            rotor. Push the left pedal, and the helicopter's nose
            will rotate to the left. Pushing the right pedal has
            the opposite effect.</p>

            <p>The lever, or wheel, on the joystick, which you use
            as a throttle in airplanes, is the collective when
            flying a helicopter. This controls pitch in the main
            rotor blades collectively. Its primary function is to
            control altitude.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sophisticated turbine-engine
            helicopters have all but eliminated the throttle from
            the collective lever. Computerized mechanisms control
            the power necessary to maintain rotor rpm appropriate
            to the collective setting chosen by the pilot. This is
            essentially how the collective works in Flight
            Simulator. The fuel control unit automatically adjusts
            the throttle (engine speed) as you move the
            collective.</p>

            <p>To control the throttle manually, press
            <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> to decrease power and <strong>CTRL+F3</strong> to
            increase power. (This procedure is not recommended
            unless you're familiar with helicopter operation.)
            Monitor the power turbine gauge to set engine power as
            a percentage of power turbine rpm.</p><a name=
            "RequiredRunwayLength"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Practically speaking, the required runway length for
            the JetRanger is the length of its skids (the long bars
            that contact the ground to support the fuselage). You
            can land this aircraft on buildings, boats, or anywhere
            except on water (in real life, JetRangers can be
            equipped with floats in order to land on
            water).</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down by clicking the
            Fuel Valve Switch, you can return to engine ON by
            clicking the Fuel Valve Switch again or by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+F4</strong>.</p><a name=
            "HoveringandTaxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Hovering and Taxiing</p>

            <p>Taxiing in a helicopter is often called hover
            taxiing. This means that you will hover just a few feet
            off the ground with a forward motion. Generally, you
            would use this technique when taxiing from one area to
            another on the airport or if you needed to move the
            helicopter a short distance.</p>

            <p>Under typical weather conditions and operating
            weights, you'll need 70 to 75 percent torque to hover
            or hover taxi. If you lift the skids more than about 3
            feet (1 meter) above the ground, the helicopter
            effectively flies out of ground effect, and you'll need
            about 10 percent more power to maintain a hover.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that under certain conditions, such as
            in tall grass, over steep or rough terrain, or at high
            altitudes, the helicopter may not be able to hover out
            of ground effect.</p>

            <p>Remember that the cyclic controls the direction in
            which the helicopter moves.</p>

            <p>Use small, smooth adjustments of the collective to
            maintain the proper altitude.</p>

            <p>To keep the nose straight, apply pressure to the
            left or right anti-torque pedal.</p><a name=
            "Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>Helicopters don't have flaps.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Note the wind direction and speed. If possible, plan
            to take off directly into the wind to minimize sideways
            drift and to increase the helicopter's performance
            during takeoff and climb.</p>

            <p>Wind blowing through the main rotor disk has the
            same effect as forward airspeed. For example, if the
            helicopter is facing into a 10- to 15-knot wind, the
            rotor experiences effective translational lift (ETL)
            even when the aircraft is on the surface.</p>

            <p>When you're ready to make a vertical takeoff, use
            scenery objects as a guide. Note a point in the
            distance (such as a building, tower, or gas pump). Use
            that point and the outside horizon as references to
            help you maintain the helicopter's alignment and
            attitude as you lift off.</p>

            <p>Set the cyclic (joystick handle) in an approximately
            neutral position. Set the collective in the full down
            position (use the joystick throttle, or press
            <strong>F2</strong>).</p>

            <p>Smoothly and slowly raise the collective (press
            <strong>F3</strong>, or push forward on the joystick throttle).
            The helicopter should become light on the skids as you
            reach 40 to 60 percent torque. Ease into this range
            smoothly and slowly.</p>

            <p>As the helicopter's weight comes off the skids, it
            will start to drift and turn to the right. Hold the
            collective steady at this point, and use slight left
            cyclic pressure to hold the helicopter in position.</p>

            <p>Apply left pedal pressure (twist the joystick to the
            left, press the left rudder pedal, or press <strong>0</strong> on
            the numeric keypad) to compensate for the torque from
            the main rotor.</p>

            <p>Keep your attention outside the helicopter, and
            focus on the horizon and other visual clues. To
            continue the liftoff, smoothly increase the
            collective.</p>

            <p>Anticipate the need to add left pedal as you lift
            off and make small, smooth corrections with the cyclic
            (move the joystick, or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> or
            <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) and pedals (twist the joystick, or
            press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the
            numeric keypad) to maintain heading and position.</p>

            <p>Hold the helicopter skids about 3 feet (1 meter)
            above the ground. You want to stay low in case the
            engine fails and to keep the helicopter in ground
            effect. You'll probably need 70 to 75 percent torque to
            maintain the hover.</p>

            <p>Raise or lower the collective to maintain altitude.
            Maintain the correct attitude using light, small cyclic
            pressures, and use the anti-torque pedals to keep the
            helicopter's nose from rotating.</p>

            <p>Anticipate corrections to compensate for wind.
            You'll need slight forward cyclic pressure if you take
            off into a headwind, left pressure with a left
            crosswind, and so forth.</p>

            <p>When you're ready to continue the takeoff, gently
            apply a small amount of forward cyclic (push the
            joystick forward, or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong>) to
            lower the nose and begin moving forward along the
            departure path. The helicopter may tend to settle as
            you start forward. Compensate by adding slight up
            collective (increase the joystick throttle setting, or
            press <strong>F3</strong>).</p>

            <p>As airspeed reaches 10 to 15 knots, the helicopter
            enters effective translational lift. The nose tends to
            yaw left and pitch up slightly. Apply some forward
            cyclic to prevent the nose from rising.</p>

            <p>Add some left lateral cyclic (push the joystick
            left, or press the <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong>) to prevent the
            helicopter from drifting right, and apply right pedal
            pressure (twist the joystick to the right, use the
            right rudder pedal, or press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the
            numeric keypad) to maintain heading. The helicopter
            will continue climbing and accelerating.</p>

            <p>If you feel like you're juggling a lot at this
            point, you are. Helicopter flying is not easy, and it's
            been described as an activity similar to trying to
            balance one ball on top of another.</p>

            <p>Continue the takeoff by flying a modified traffic
            pattern. Climb straight ahead at 60 knots to 300 feet
            (90 meters). The helicopter should be in a nearly
            nose-level attitude.</p>

            <p>Turn 90 degrees left (standard traffic pattern) or
            right to the crosswind leg. Maintain 60 knots indicated
            airspeed (KIAS) and continue the climb to 500 feet (150
            meters).</p>

            <p>To accelerate and maintain rate of climb, increase
            collective and add slight forward cyclic. On the
            crosswind leg, depart the traffic pattern or return for
            another landing by turning 90 degrees again to join the
            downwind leg.</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>The Bell 206B JetRanger III can achieve a maximum
            rate of climb of about 1,300 feet per minute at sea
            level under standard weather conditions. The aircraft's
            best rate-of-climb airspeed is 52 knots. However, 60
            knots is a good climb speed because it's also the speed
            to use for autorotation if the engine fails.</p>

            <p>For a normal climb, adjust the collective (use the
            joystick throttle, or press <strong>F3</strong>) for a torque
            setting about 10 percent above that required to
            maintain a hover in ground effect.</p>

            <p>Under standard conditions and at typical operating
            weights, you'll need 80 to 85 percent torque for a
            normal climb. Use the cyclic (the joystick or the ARROW
            keys) to set a pitch attitude that maintains an
            airspeed of about 60 knots.</p>

            <p>Note that as you climb, the engine produces less
            power. As a rule of thumb, expect torque to drop 3
            percent per 1,000 feet (305 meters) of altitude gained.
            Monitor the engine instruments and smoothly add
            collective to maintain climb power as your altitude
            increases.</p>

            <p>Keep the following considerations in mind as you
            climb:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use the collective to control power and the rate
              of the climb.</li>

              <li>Monitor engine instruments closely to ensure that
              you stay within operating limits.</li>

              <li>Maintain attitude (thus airspeed) by looking out
              to the horizon. Focusing on a point too close to the
              nose makes it difficult to maintain the proper
              aircraft attitude.</li>

              <li>Use the cyclic to control airspeed (and the
              helicopter's attitude) and the anti-torque pedals to
              maintain heading or to establish a crab angle as
              necessary to fly a constant ground track.</li>

              <li>Use the anti-torque pedals to maintain trim
              (coordinated flight). A slip or skid severely
              degrades climb performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To level off from a climb, start decreasing
            collective about 50 feet (15 meters) below the altitude
            at which you want to level off. Add right anti-torque
            pedal as you decrease torque to the cruise setting
            (about 80 percent torque). Use the cyclic to maintain
            cruising airspeed. Apply forward cyclic to increase
            speed and aft cyclic to slow down.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Under typical conditions, you should set the
            collective to 80 percent torque for efficient cruising
            flight. At this power setting, 5 percent below the
            maximum-allowed continuous power setting, the Bell 206B
            JetRanger III typically cruises at about 105 knolts
            while burning 25 to 28 gallons (94 to 106 liters) of
            fuel per hour.</p>

            <p>To maintain the desired track over the ground, use
            the anti-torque pedals to turn the helicopter into the
            wind and establish the correct crab angle.</p>

            <p>To turn, use the cyclic to bank the helicopter.</p>

            <p>Use the anti-torque pedals to keep the helicopter in
            trim&#8212;that is, in coordinated flight. If the
            inclinometer in the turn coordinator shows a slip or a
            skid, apply left or right pedal pressure as necessary
            to center the ball.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>To descend at a comfortable rate without building
            too much speed, you must decrease main rotor pitch by
            lowering the collective (use the joystick throttle, or
            press <strong>F2</strong>). Anticipate the need for the right
            anti-torque pedal as you decrease torque.</p>

            <p>The nose drops as you lower collective, so remember
            that you'll need to add a little aft cyclic (pull the
            joystick aft, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to
            maintain the correct pitch attitude and airspeed. Don't
            add too much aft cyclic, however: the aircraft will
            climb.</p>

            <p>Note that as you descend, the engine produces more
            power. As a rule of thumb, expect torque to increase 3
            percent per 1,000 feet (305 meters) of descent. Monitor
            the engine instruments and smoothly reduce collective
            to continue your descent.</p>

            <p>To level off from a descent, start increasing
            collective about 50 feet (15 meters) above the altitude
            at which you want to level off. Add left anti-torque
            pedal as you increase torque to the cruise setting
            (about 80 percent torque). Use the cyclic to maintain
            cruising airspeed. Apply forward cyclic to increase
            speed and aft cyclic to slow down.</p><a name=
            "Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>Approaches in a helicopter have more to do with
            local traffic and terrain than a need to be at a target
            speed and configuration. Enter the airport traffic area
            in a safe manner that avoids obstacles, and follow the
            landing procedures as described.</p><a name=
            "Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>To land the JetRanger III, reverse the procedure for
            a normal takeoff. That is, fly an approach from a
            500-foot (150-meter) traffic pattern, enter a hover at
            about 3 feet (1 meter) above the ground, and then
            slowly and smoothly lower the aircraft to the
            ground.</p>

            <p>Following this procedure helps you establish good
            habits and makes it easier to achieve smooth,
            consistent landings.</p>

            <p>Review the landing checklist on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <p>Fly a modified traffic pattern that avoids the flow
            of fixed-wing traffic.</p>

            <p>During the first half of the approach, decrease
            power by lowering the collective (use the joystick
            throttle, or press F2). During the second half of the
            approach, you must smoothly increase power to arrive at
            the 3-foot (1-meter) hover just as you set hover power,
            usually 70 to 75 percent torque.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Fly the downwind leg at 500 feet (150 meters) at
              100 knots.</li>

              <li>Turn to the base leg, decelerate to 70 knots, and
              then descend to 300 feet (90 meters).</li>

              <li>Turn final at 300 feet (90 meters), and
              decelerate to 52 to 60 knots.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A descent angle of 10 to 12 degrees provides good
            obstacle clearance and helps you keep the landing area
            in sight.</p>

            <p>Adjust the collective to control rate of descent.
            Increase collective (use the joystick throttle, or
            press <strong>F3</strong>) to reduce the rate of descent;
            decrease collective (use the joystick throttle or press
            <strong>F2</strong>) slightly to increase rate of descent.</p>

            <p>Use the cyclic (the joystick or <strong>ARROW</strong> keys)
            to adjust the rate of closure with your landing spot.
            Apply slight aft cyclic to reduce the rate of closure;
            forward pressure increases the rate of closure. The
            ideal forward rate of travel is that of a normal
            walk.</p>

            <p>Continue the approach until the rate of closure with
            the landing spot accelerates. Begin dissipating forward
            speed by applying smooth, slight back pressure on the
            cyclic. As you decelerate, anticipate the need to
            decrease collective to maintain altitude.</p>

            <p>As airspeed drops to 10 to 15 knots, the aircraft
            will lose effective translational lift. You must add up
            collective to compensate for the loss of lift. You'll
            also need to add left anti-torque pedal pressure as you
            increase collective pitch.</p>

            <p>Transition to the hover over the landing spot. Enter
            a 3-foot (1-meter) hover over the spot where you want
            to land. Slowly lower the collective and allow the
            helicopter to settle onto the landing spot. Once the
            aircraft is down, lower the collective all the way
            (move the joystick throttle full aft, or press
            <strong>F1</strong>).</p><a name="Autorotation"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Autorotation</p>

            <p>Autorotation in a helicopter is the equivalent of a
            power-off glide in an airplane. The following
            procedures will help you land the Bell 206B JetRanger
            III after a simulated engine failure.</p>

            <p>During autorotation, it's important to maintain
            rotor rpm so you have lift available to cushion the
            landing. You must also maintain the correct forward
            speed so that you can reach a suitable landing area and
            flare to reduce the rate of descent before ground
            contact.</p>

            <p>In the Bell 206B JetRanger III, the best glide ratio
            is about 4 to 1. That is, the helicopter can fly
            forward 4 feet for every foot of altitude lost.</p>

            <p>To achieve this glide ratio and travel the greatest
            distance, maintain 69 KIAS, the maximum-distance glide
            speed. Use the cyclic (the joystick or <strong>ARROW</strong>
            keys) to adjust pitch to maintain best glide.</p>

            <p>To descend at the minimum-sink rate, fly at 52 KIAS.
            You won't cover as much distance, but you'll stay in
            the air for a longer time. You may want to use the
            minimum-sink airspeed if you're directly over a landing
            area.</p>

            <p>Here are some tips to help you fly the JetRanger III
            in an autorotation:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>If the engine fails, you must decrease collective
              smoothly and immediately to preserve and maintain
              rotor rpm (use the joystick throttle, or press
              <strong>F1</strong>). Remember&#8212;smoothly. If you abruptly
              lower the collective, the helicopter will develop a
              high sink rate. Establish a glide at 52 to 69 KIAS,
              depending on your selected landing area.</li>

              <li>Stabilized rotor RPM in autorotation at 1,000
              feet (305 meters) should be 93 to 95 percent under
              ISA conditions.</li>

              <li>As the helicopter descends to 75 to 50 feet, (23
              to 15 meters) apply gentle aft cyclic (pull the
              joystick aft, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to
              establish about a 10-degree nose-up attitude until
              approximately 15 ft (5 m) above the ground. After
              ground speed is reduced, apply forward cyclic to
              level the helicopter.</li>

              <li>Cushion the landing by adding some collective
              (move the joystick throttle forward, or press
              <strong>F3</strong>) as required.</li>

              <li>To maintain heading, you'll need to add right
              pedal (twist the joystick, use the right rudder
              pedal, or press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the numeric keypad)
              as you apply collective pitch because mechanical drag
              in the transmission yaws the nose left. (If you are
              practicing autorotations and recovering with power,
              you must add left pedal as you increase power.)</li>

              <li>Make sure you land with the helicopter level and
              with little or no forward speed or drift.</li>

              <li>After ground contact, center the cyclic and
              gently lower the collective.</li>

              <li>Remember this sequence: Flare, pitch, level, and
              cushion.</li>

            <p class="SubHead">Straight-in Autorotation</p>

            <p>To practice a straight-in autorotation, use the
            following procedure:</p>

            <p>Enter the traffic pattern at 500 feet (152 meters)
            and 70 to 105 KIAS.</p>

            <p>Close the throttle to flight idle (press
            <strong>CTRL+F2</strong>).</p>

            <p>Smoothly but quickly, lower the collective to the
            full-down position. Apply a slight amount of aft cyclic
            pressure to keep the nose from dropping and to
            decelerate to 52 to 69 KIAS. Be careful not to jerk the
            cyclic back and forth, chasing the airspeed.</p>

            <p>Keep the helicopter in trim using pedal pressure
            (use rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> [left] or
            <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the numeric keypad). Control
            drift using the cyclic. Make sure the skids are
            straight before entering the flare.</p>

            <p>At about 75 feet (23 meters), keep your eyes on the
            landing spot so you can judge the rate of closure.
            Begin the final deceleration and flare by smoothly
            increasing aft cyclic pressure. You should be 10 to 15
            feet (3 to 4 meters) above the ground as the helicopter
            starts to settle.</p>

            <p>As the helicopter settles toward the ground, make
            sure you establish a level pitch attitude. Smoothly
            apply up collective to reduce sink rate and cushion the
            touchdown.</p>

            <p>Apply right pedal to keep the nose absolutely
            straight.</p>

            <p>Use cyclic pressure as necessary during this
            transition to keep the aircraft level and compensate

            Turn</p>

            <p>Practicing an autorotation with a 180-degree turn
            develops your ability to plan ahead and control the
            helicopter smoothly and precisely.</p>

            <p>Begin this maneuver at 500 feet (152 meters) and 70
            to 105 KIAS.</p>

            <p>Establish a downwind leg 150 to 250 feet (46 to 76
            meters) from the landing area.</p>

            <p>Abeam your intended landing spot, enter the
            autorotation by moving the collective to the full down
            position (move the joystick throttle full aft, or press
            <strong>F1</strong>).</p>

            <p>Turn to the base leg as you stabilize in the
            autorotation. Remember to use the cyclic, not the
            pedals, to turn. Use the pedals to maintain coordinated
            flight. A slip or a skid causes a drop in airspeed,
            increases sink rate, and shortens the glide.</p>

            <p>Use the cyclic to maintain the proper descent
            attitude and airspeed at about 60 KIAS. Look out toward
            the horizon to help you maintain the proper
            attitude.</p>

            <p>Roll out on final with the cyclic, and complete the
            deceleration, flare, and touchdown as in a straight-in
            autorotation.</p>
