            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 1,220 pounds (553.3 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="Enginestartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine startup</p>

            <p>The engine is running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engine down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the kneeboard.</p>

            <p>The throttle on the Cub controls engine power, from
            idle to takeoff power. The normal operating range is
            from 450 to 2,300 rpm. The Piper J3 Cub has a fixed
            pitch propeller.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>The normal power setting for taxiing is 1,000 rpm
            (press <strong>F2</strong> on the keyboard, or drag the power
            levers). Forward visibility is limited so you need to
            make S-turns as you taxi. Use the rudder pedals to move
            the nose side-to-side as you move forward in order to
            see what is ahead of you.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>The Piper J3 Cub does not have wing
            flaps.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist. With the
            aircraft aligned with the runway centerline, smoothly
            advance the throttle lever to full power. Directional
            control is maintained by use of the rudder pedals
            (twist the joystick, use rudder pedals, or press
            <strong>0</strong> (left) or <strong>ENTER</strong> (right) on the numeric
            keypad).</p>

              <li>At approximately 20 mph (17.4 knots) indicated
              airspeed, the tail will come up.</li>

              <li>At approximately 35 mph (30.4 knots), smoothly
              pull the stick back (use the joystick or yoke or
              press <strong>2</strong> on the numeric keypad) to raise the
              nose. The airplane will become airborne at
              approximately 39 mph (34 knots).</li>
            </ul><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>The best climb speed for the Cub is 55 mph (48
            knots).</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for 5,000 feet
            (1,524 meters). Approaching your cruising altitude,
            begin leveling off at about 50 feet (15 meters) below
            your target altitude.</p>

            <p>A typical power setting in the Cub for the
            parameters chosen above is 2,150 rpm. Do not fly at
            full throttle (2,300 rpm) for more than three minutes.
            Cruise speed is generally between 75 and 80 mph (65 and
            69 knots).</p>

            <p>Remember that true airspeed is actually higher than
            indicated airspeed in thin, cold air. Experiment with
            power settings to find the setting that maintains the
            cruise speed and fuel consumption you want at the
            altitude that you choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with cruise power.
            A good rule for determining when to start your descent
            is the 3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand
            feet in altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the
            last three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            5,000 feet (1,524 meters) to sea level:<br>
            5,000 minus the last three zeros is 5.<br>
            5x3=15</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 15 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 120
            mph (104 knots) or less (it won't indicate this high
            until you descend into denser air) and a descent rate
            of approximately 500 feet per minute.</p><a name=
            "Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>Approaches in the Cub are basic. Enter downwind at
            75 mph (use the joystick throttle or press <strong>F2</strong>).
            As you turn onto final, reduce your speed to 55 to 60
            mph (48 to 52 knots).</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Landing a taildragger requires a different technique
            than does landing a tricycle-gear airplane. The Cub can
            be landed using either a wheel landing or a three-point
            landing technique. Some pilots feel the three-point
            landing is easier if the wind conditions are favorable,
            and with high winds, strong gusts, or a crosswind, a
            wheel landing is often easier. For a more thorough
            discussion of three-point vs. wheel landing, see
            <a href=
            "../AdvancedFlyingSkills/FlyingTaildraggers.htm">Flying
            a Taildragger</a>. A key issue, however, is to keep the
            airplane aligned with the runway, in other words, to
            land straight. The center of gravity is behind the main
            wheels of a taildragger. If you're not straight when
            the wheels touch down the airplane's tail will try to
            swing around. <strong>Directional control is essential when
            maneuvering a taildragger on the ground so be prepared
            to work the rudders to stay straight.</strong></p>

            <p>To perform a three-point landing in the Cub, make a
            normal flare just above the runway. Ideally the
            airplane will be in an attitude at which all three
            wheels will touch down at the same time. Hold this
            attitude until the airplane settles onto the runway.
            Once the wheels are on the ground, pull the stick back
            and hold it there.</p>

            <p>When doing a wheel landing in the Cub raise the nose
            slightly to flare and slow the descent rate. You want
            to touch down as lightly on the main gear as possible.
            Once the Cub mains are down, bring the power back to
            idle and apply a little nose-down or forward pressure
            on the elevator (push the joystick forward or press
            <strong>ARROW UP</strong>). Don't pull the stick back to lower
            the tail or you'll find yourself in the air again.
            Don't be too quick to use the brakes either, or the
            airplane will pitch over onto its nose. Let the
            airplane slow and the tail will begin to drop. Then
            hold some back pressure on the controls (hold the
            joystick aft or press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>).</p>

            <p>Apply the brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key) to
            slow to taxi speed, exit the runway, and taxi to
            parking. Don't be discouraged if you bounce the Cub
            when learning to land it. It takes a lot of practice to
            land it smoothly.</p>
