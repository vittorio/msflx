            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Takeoff: 4,700 feet (1,432 meters), flaps 8<br>
            Landing: 3,200 feet (975 meters), flaps 20</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176; C</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>To taxi the Learjet, use just enough power to get it
            rolling, and then bring the thrust levers back to idle.
            Idle thrust will work fine for keeping you
            moving.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>All of the following occurs quite rapidly. Read
            through the procedure several times before attempting
            it in the plane so you know what to expect.</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist, and set
            flaps to 8 or 20 as desired (press <strong>F7</strong>, or drag
            the flaps lever). With the aircraft aligned with the
            runway centerline, advance the throttles (press
            <strong>F3</strong>, or drag the levers) to approximately 40
            percent N1. This allows the engines to spool up to a
            point where uniform acceleration to takeoff thrust will
            occur on both engines. The exact amount of initial
            setting is not as important as setting symmetrical
            thrust.</p>

            <p>After the engines are stabilized, advance the thrust
            levers to takeoff thrust&#8212;generally 93 to 96
            percent N1 (less with high outside air
            temperatures).</p>

            <p>Directional control is maintained by use of the
            rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder
            pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            [right] on the numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>At V1, approximately 136 knots indicated airspeed
            (KIAS), is decision speed. Above this speed, it may not
            be possible to stop the aircraft on the runway in case
            of a rejected takeoff (RTO).</p>

            <p>At Vr, approximately 143 KIAS, smoothly pull the
            stick back (use the joystick or yoke, or press the
            <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to raise the nose to 10 degrees
            above the horizon. Hold this pitch attitude and be
            careful not to over-rotate.</p>

            <p>At V2, approximately 146 KIAS, the aircraft has
            reached its takeoff safety speed. This is the minimum
            safe flying speed should an engine fail. Hold this
            speed until you get a positive rate of climb.</p>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb (both vertical speed and altitude are
            increasing), retract the landing gear (press G on the
            keyboard, or drag the landing gear lever). The aircraft
            will quickly accelerate to the flap-retraction speed.
            This number is V2+ 30, or about 176 knots. Retract the
            flaps (press <strong>F6</strong>, or drag the flaps
            lever).</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>After retracting the gear and flaps, you don't need
            to reduce power unless you level off below 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters) and you need to remain below FAA speed
            limits. To remain level at 200 KIAS at 2,000 feet (610
            meters), for example, pull the power back to 53 to 55
            percent N1. A power setting of 60 to 63 percent will
            get you 250 KIAS while level at this altitude.</p>

            <p>If you continue your climb above 10,000 feet, leave
            the power up as long as it remains below the &quot;max
            continuous temperature&quot; on the interstage turbine
            temperature gauge (ITT). You should be climbing at
            1,800 to 2,000 feet per minute. Learjet drivers run
            their engines at maximum a good deal of the time.</p>

            <p>Increase the pitch attitude to maintain 250 knots
            until reaching 0.7 Mach. Then, maintain 0.7 Mach for
            the rest of the climb. The changeover from indicated
            airspeed to Mach number typically occurs as you climb
            to altitudes in the high 20s or low 30s.</p>

            <p>You'll have to increase power as you climb to
            maintain the profile just described. Like piston
            engines, turbine powerplants slowly lose power as the
            air gets thinner.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally determined by winds,
            weather, and other factors. You might want to use these
            factors in your flight planning if you have created
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>The Learjet is designed to fly high. You can cruise
            as high as FL450 (the airplane is certified to 51,000
            feet), but the only payoffs for burning the fuel it
            takes to get there would be getting above a weather
            system or taking advantage of especially favorable
            winds.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for FL350. When
            you approach your cruising altitude, begin leveling off
            at about 50 feet (15 meters) below your target
            altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the Learjet
            in cruise if you use the autopilot. The autopilot can
            hold the altitude, speed, heading, or navaid course you
            specify. For more information about using the
            autopilot, see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingAnAutopilot.htm">Using an
            Autopilot</a>.</p>

            <p>Normal cruise speed is 0.77 Mach. Set power at
            around 90 percent N1. If you're showing indicated
            airspeed on the airspeed gauge, the needle will settle
            down at about 280 KIAS.</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher in the thin, cold air. At FL370, you can count
            on a speed over the ground of about 429 knots (794
            kilometers per hour, or 494 mph).</p>

            <p>In cruise, the Learjet 45 gives its best
            maximum-weight speed performance at 33,000 feet (10,058
            meters), where it zips along at 444 KIAS, burning
            around 1,715 pounds of fuel per hour.</p><a name=
            "Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing when to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude.) Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            35,000 feet (10,668 meters) to sea level:<br>
            35,000 minus the last three zeros is 35.<br>
            35 x 3=105</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 105
            nautical miles from your destination, maintaining a
            speed of 250 KIAS and a descent rate of 1,500 to 2,000
            feet per minute, with thrust set at flight idle to 53
            percent N1. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>To descend, disengage the autopilot if you turned it
            on during cruise (or use the autopilot hold features
            and let it fly for you). Reduce power to idle, and
            lower the nose slightly. Remember not to exceed the
            regulation speed limit of 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). You may have to adjust power to
            maintain your speed and rate of descent. Continue this
            profile down to the beginning of the approach phase of
            flight.</p>

            <p>Deviations from the above can result in arriving too
            high at the destination (requiring circling to descend)
            or arriving too low and far out (requiring expenditure
            of extra time and fuel). Plan to have an initial
            approach fix regardless of whether or not you're flying
            an instrument approach.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>A good target speed as you enter the downwind for
            VFR flight or at your initial approach fix for IFR
            flight is 200 KIAS. As you begin the approach but
            before you turn toward the runway, bring the power
            back, and hold altitude to reduce speed. Extend 8
            degrees of flaps. Let the airplane stabilize at 180
            knots.</p>

            <p>During the first turn toward the runway (either on
            the base leg or when turning inbound on an ILS), extend
            20 degrees of flaps.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>When you're approaching the normal descent point on
            a visual approach, or one dot below the glideslope
            approaching the final approach fix on an ILS approach,
            extend the landing gear.</p>

            <p>Smoothly increase power to maintain 140 knots, your
            final approach speed. As you intercept the glideslope,
            set 40 degrees of flaps. This configuration should hold
            airspeed at 140 knots with a good descent angle toward
            the runway.</p>

            <p>Hold 140 knots all the way down on final approach.
            Use small power adjustments to stay on the glidepath.
            Look for a descent rate of about 700 fpm.</p>

            <p>At about 50 feet above the runway and past the
            runway threshold, bring the thrust levers to idle. Hold
            the pitch attitude you've used during final approach.
            Don't try to raise or lower the nose. When you touch
            down, deploy the spoilers (press the <strong>SLASH</strong> [ /
            ]), and add reverse thrust (press <strong>F2</strong>, or drag
            the thrust levers into the reverse position), and apply
            brakes.</p>

            <p>Make sure you come out of reverse thrust (press
            <strong>F1</strong>, or drag the thrust levers), and lower the
            spoilers as airspeed drops below 60 knots. Exit the
            runway, and taxi to parking.</p>
