            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day

            <p>Takeoff: 1,200 feet (366 meters) no flaps<br>
            Landing: 1,300 feet (396 meters) approach flaps
            fully extended to FULL</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 5,100 pounds (2,313 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: Sea level<br>
            Wind: No headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#186;C<br>
            Runway: Hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures result in better
            performance, as does having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="Engine startup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The throttle lever on the Beaver controls
              engine power, from idle to takeoff power. Moving the
              throttles forward increases engine power.</li>

              <li>The propeller lever is operated forward and aft
              for setting the required revolutions per minute (rpm) 
			  for various phases of
              flight. The normal range is from 1,600 to 2,150
              RPM.</li>
            </ul><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Whether on the water or on land, the Beaver amphibian
			 has good visibility over the nose because the pilot's 
			 seat is up high. The normal power setting for taxiing 
			 is between 800-1,000 rpm (press F2 on the keyboard or 
			 drag the power lever).</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>On the Beaver, available flap settings are Climb, Takeoff,
			 Landing, and Full. The flaps cannot be stopped at an 
			 intermediate point between these positions. See the Kneeboard
			  for the flap operating speeds.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the <strong>Before Takeoff</strong> checklist 
			found on the Kneeboard. With the
            aircraft aligned with the runway centerline, check that
            the propeller levers are full forward, and the
            tailwheel is locked. Directional control is maintained
            by use of the rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use
            rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> (left) or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            (right) on the numeric keypad). Takeoff power is 32&quot; Hg
            and 2100 rpm at sea level in standard atmosphere.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>V1, approximately 80 mph (70 knots), is decision
              speed. Gently pull back on
              the joystick or yoke to take off. Hold this speed until you
              achieve a positive rate of climb.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude
            are increasing), retract the landing gear (press
            <strong>G</strong> or drag the landing gear lever) and allow the
            speed to increase.</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>At 92 mph (80 knots), reduce power to 28&quot; Hg
            manifold pressure and reduce props to 2,000 rpm. (Press
            <strong>F2</strong>, use the throttle control on your joystick,
            or drag the throttle levers to set the manifold
            pressure. Press <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> or drag the propeller
            levers to set the rpm.) Raise the flaps and maintain this speed 
			while climbing to your cruising altitude.</p>

            <p>The optimum Beaver climb speed is 92 mph (80
            knots). Adjust the mixture and throttle settings as you climb
            to maintain the best rate of climb.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). Approaching your cruising altitude,
            begin leveling off at about 50 feet (15 meters) below
            your target altitude.</p>

            <p>A typical cruise power setting in the Beaver is 21" Hg
			 manifold pressure and 1,700 rpm. That will give you an 
			 indicated airspeed of around 110 mph and a fuel burn of 
			 approximately 15 gallons per hour.</p>

            <p>Remember that true airspeed is actually higher than
            indicated airspeed in thin, cold air. Experiment
            with power settings to find the setting that maintains
            the cruise speed and fuel consumption you want at the
            altitude that you choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with no less than
            20&quot; of manifold pressure and 2,050 rpm. A good rule for
            determining when to start your descent is the 3-to-1
            rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            10,000 feet (3,048 meters) to sea level:<br>
            10,000 minus the last three zeros is 10.<br>
            10x3=30</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 30 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 135
            mph (103 knots; it may not indicate this high until you
            descend into denser air) and a descent rate of 500 feet
            per minute. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>In the Beaver, adjust thrust during descent to maintain
			 135 mph (use the joystick throttle or press F2 to decrease 
			 thrust, or press F3 to increase thrust). The propeller lever 
			 should remain at 1,900 rpm.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>As you near the approach phase of flight, bring the
            power back to 15&quot; and fly at
            70 mph on downwind. When you intercept the glide
            slope or enter the downwind, set the flaps to Landing
            (press <strong>F6</strong> or click the flap lever) and put the
            landing gear down (press <strong>G</strong> or click the landing
            gear lever) if landing on a hard-surface runway. If the 
			landing gear malfunctions, press
            <strong>CTRL+G</strong> repeatedly to manually lower the
            gear.</p>

            <p>Turning base, go to full flaps. Over the fence you
            should reduce speed to 70 mph. In the full-flaps, 
			high-drag configuration, you may need to use more power to 
			maintain speed.</p><a name=
            "Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

			<p>If landing on the water, make sure the landing gear are UP.
			If landing on a hard surface, make sure the landing gear are DOWN.</p>
			
            <p>As you cross the threshold at around 50 feet (15
            meters) AGL, the power should be as required and the prop
			should be full forward.</p>

            <p>Raise the nose slightly to flare and slow the
            descent rate. Bring the power back to idle and hold
            some back pressure on the controls (hold the joystick
            aft or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) key.</p>

            <p>Once all of the wheels are on the runway (hard surface), apply the
            brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key) to slow to taxi
            speed, exit the runway, and taxi to parking.</p>
			
			<p>Once down on a water runway, lower the water rudders
			 (press the <strong>CTRL+W</strong>) to taxi.</p>
