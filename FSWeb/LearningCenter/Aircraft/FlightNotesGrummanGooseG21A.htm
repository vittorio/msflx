            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 9,000 pounds (4,082 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: Sea level<br>
            Wind: No headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#186;C<br>
            Runway: Hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures result in better
            performance, as does having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="Engine startup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The throttle levers on the Goose control
              engine power, from idle to takeoff power. As you move
			   the throttles forward engine power increases.</li>

              <li>The propeller levers are operated forward and aft
              for setting the required revolutions per minute (rpm) 
			  for various phases of flight.</li>
            </ul><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>On land, because the Goose is a taildragger, you may need
			 to raise the seat (press SHIFT+ENTER). The normal power 
			 setting for taxiing is between 800-1,000 rpm (press F2 on 
			 the keyboard, or drag the power levers). You can lock the 
			 tailwheel during any long, straight portions of the taxi 
			 path to make directional control easier (press SHIFT+G).</p>
			 
			 <p>For information about taxiing on water, see <a href="..\advancedflyingskills\flyingfloatplanesindex.htm">Flying Floatplanes</a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>On the Goose, available flap settings are from 30-60 degrees.
			 See the Kneeboard	for the flap operating speeds.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff (water)</p>

            <p>Run through the <strong>Before Takeoff</strong> checklist 
			found on the Kneeboard. With the
            aircraft aligned with the runway centerline, check that
            the propeller levers are full forward, and the
            tailwheel is locked. Directional control is maintained
            by use of the rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use
            rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> (left) or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            (right) on the numeric keypad).</p>
			
			<p>To reduce spray when taking off from the water, use the maximum takeoff 
			manifold pressure of 36.5" Hg. Hold the joystick back all the way until 
			on the step. To learn more about flying amphibians, see <a href="..\advancedflyingskills\flyingfloatplanesindex.htm">Flying Floatplanes</a>
			in the Learning Center.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A takeoff from water with a full load and no wind 
			  will take about 15 seconds.</li>

              <li>Once airborne, raise the wing floats using the switch
			   on the overhead panel (press <strong>SHIFT+6</strong> to display the overhead panel).</li>

			<li>As soon as the aircraft is flying above 108 mph (93 knots),
			 reduce power to 30" Hg and 2,000 rpm.</li>

              <li>At approximately 40 mph (35 knots), the tail will come
			   up (use the joystick or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> key to apply some 
			   forward pressure).</li>

              <li>At around 75 mph (65 knots), gently pull back on the 
			  controls to take off.</li>

			<li>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate of climb
			 on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude are increasing), 
			 retract the landing gear (press <strong>G</strong> or drag the landing gear lever) 
			 and allow the speed to increase.</li>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>At 108 mph (93 knots), reduce power to 30" Hg manifold pressure
			 and 2,000 rpm. (Press <strong>F2</strong>, use the throttle control on your joystick,
			  or drag the throttle levers to set the manifold pressure. Press 
			  <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> or drag the propeller levers to set the rpm.) Maintain this 
			  speed while climbing to your cruising altitude.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for 5,000 feet
            (1,524 meters). Approaching your cruising altitude,
            begin leveling off at about 50 feet (15 meters) below
            your target altitude.</p>

            <p>A typical cruise power setting in the Goose is 27" Hg
			 manifold pressure and 1,900 rpm, giving you an 
			 indicated airspeed of around 130 mph (113 knots) at 5,000 feet.</p>

            <p>Remember that true airspeed is actually higher than
            indicated airspeed in thin, cold air. Experiment
            with power settings to find the setting that maintains
            the cruise speed and fuel consumption you want at the
            altitude that you choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. A good rule for
            determining when to start your descent is the 3-to-1
            rule (three miles distance per thousand feet of
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            5,000 feet (1,524 meters) to sea level:<br>
            5,000 minus the last three zeros is 5.<br>
            5 x 3=15</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 15 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 130
            mph (113 knots; it may not indicate this high until you
            descend into denser air) and a descent rate of 500 feet
            per minute. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>In the Goose, adjust thrust during descent to maintain
			 130 mph (use the joystick throttle or press <strong>F2</strong> to decrease 
			 thrust, or press <strong>F3</strong> to increase thrust). The propeller lever 
			 should remain at 1,900 rpm.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>As you near the approach phase of flight, bring the
            power back to 15&quot; and fly at
            90 mph on downwind. When you intercept the glide
            slope or enter the downwind, set the flaps to 30 degrees
            (press <strong>F6</strong> or click the flap lever).
			
			<ul>
				<li>If you're landing on the water, check that the 
				landing gear is retracted.</li>
				
				<li>If you're landing on a hard-surface runway, lower the
            landing gear (press <strong>G</strong> or click the landing
            gear lever). If the landing gear fails to lower
			automatically, press <strong>CTRL+G</strong> repeatedly to lower the
            gear manually.</li>
			</ul>

            <p>Abeam the touchdown point, lower the flaps to 40 degrees.
			 Turning base, go to full flaps.</p>
			 
			 <p><strong>Note</strong>: With full flaps, the approach angle 
			 is steep in this airplane. If you are new to the Goose, you 
			 may want to make the first few landings with flaps at 30 
			 degrees. However, all water landings should be made with flaps
			  set to 60 degrees.</p>

			<p>Once committed to landing you should maintain 90 mph (78 knots).</p><a name=
            "Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing (water or hard surface)</p>

            <p>The forward deck of the Grumman Goose is level when in a 
			three-point attitude for landing. To learn more about three-point 
			landings, see <a href="..\advancedflyingskills\FlyingTaildraggers.htm">
			Flying Taildraggers</a> in the Learning Center.</p>

            <p>As you cross the threshold at around 50 feet (15 meters) AGL, 
			maintain a slightly nose-low attitude with flaps down. Whether landing
			 on the water or land, maintain this attitude to within a few feet 
			 of contact.</p>

            <p>Raise the nose slightly to flare and slow the descent rate. 
			Bring the power back to idle and hold some back pressure on the 
			controls (hold the joystick aft or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong> key).
