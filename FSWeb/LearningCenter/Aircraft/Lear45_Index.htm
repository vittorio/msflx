            <p><a href="FlightNotesLear45.htm">Flight
            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the Lear 45</p>

            <p>The Model 45 is Learjet's first all-new aircraft
            since Bill Lear's first Model 23. Although it looks
            like a Learjet, it has only half the parts of a Model
            35, reflecting a significant design progression. The
            parameters set down for the 45 called for it to have
            the performance of the Learjet 35, the handling of the
            Learjet 31A, and greater cabin space than the
            competition.</p>

            <p>This is Learjet's first paperless airplane, designed
            entirely on a computer screen. In some cases, the
            computer design files are loaded directly into
            production milling machines, which allows for an
            exceptional degree of precision in manufacturing
            (especially important when major parts that have to fit
            together are made on different continents!). This
            reduces not only time in construction but also the rate
            of rejection of parts (inherent in any manufacturing
            process).</p>

            <p>Like so many ventures today, building Learjets is a
            cooperative arrangement of various entities. Learjet is
            responsible for systems and final assembly in the
            United States; the fuselage is built by Shorts in
            Ireland; and the wing design and construction is
            handled by de Havilland in Canada (all Bombardier
            subsidiaries).</p>

            <p>Ease of operation was a key design goal with the new
            Learjet. In addition to fewer parts, the craft has a
            built-in maintenance tracking system. A technician can
            plug a laptop computer into a panel and download a
            fault list from all of the avionics, engines, and other
            systems.</p>

            <p>The 45's glass cockpit makes for simplified
            in-flight system management. The Primus 1000 integrated
            avionics system and engine instrument/crew advisory
            system (EICAS) has a page for monitoring every major
            system as well as for displaying primary flight
            instruments.</p>

            <p>Power management usually creates a high workload
            when flying jets, thus requiring new power settings
            with changes in weight and ambient conditions. The
            Learjet 45 takes much of the power management off the
            pilots' hands by computing it for them. For takeoff,
            for example, advance the thrust levers three clicks to
            the takeoff position, feet off the brakes, and you're
            out of here. During the climb, ease the levers back a
            notch to the max continuous thrust (MCT) position, and
            let the digital electronic engine computer (DEEC) worry
            about the rest.</p>

            <p>At 45,000 feet and a weight of 17,000 pounds, the
            high-speed cruise number is 445 KIAS with a fuel flow
            of about 1,062 pounds per hour (pph). Back the power
            down to a long-range cruise setting, and the speed
            decreases to 408 knots, while fuel burn slows to 987
            pounds per hour. The 45 has a maximum IFR range of
            about 1,800 nautical miles. With a maximum operating
            altitude of 51,000 feet, the 45 easily reaches and
            cruises at 45,000 feet, unlike some lighter jets that
            are certified to 45,000 feet, but are rarely used at
            that altitude.</p>

            <p>Learjet has shown once again its ability to adapt to
            the market and produce what the customer wants. In the
            Model 45, they have crafted a machine that gets the
            customer there on time and in comfort while keeping the
            pilots and the corporate flight office happy.</p>
