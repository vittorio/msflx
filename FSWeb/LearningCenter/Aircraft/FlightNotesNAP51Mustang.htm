            <p><strong>Note</strong>: the P-51 Mustang included in <em>Flight 
			Simulator X: Acceleration</em> is modeled as a heavily-modified
			version of North American's original WWII aircraft. It is designed 
			primarily for racing and is fast, highly-maneuverable, and great fun
			to fly. At high <a href="../options/realism.htm">realism settings</a>, 
			however, it is inherently less stable
			and more challenging to fly than a stock P-51. High realism settings also
			increase the possibility of engine damage when running at high
			power settings.</p>
			
			<p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            Altitude: sea level<br>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures result in better
            performance, as does having a headwind component.

            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <p>The throttle on the P-51 controls engine power, from
            idle to takeoff power. The P-51 has an adjustable-pitch 
			propeller.</p>

			<p class="SubHead">Racing Operations</p><br>
			
			<p>Winning races is not about one single skill. Major factors in 
			successful racing include judicious use of boost power and close
			management of engine cooling. Race speed is 460 mph 
			(743 km/h) with 130 inches of manifold pressure and 3,450 RPM.</p>
			
			<p>At the Reno, Nevada race course (5,100 feet/1,554 meters MSL) 
			at full throttle 
			and 3,000 RPM, you should see 70-80 inches of manifold pressure. 
			As the propeller lever is moved forward, manifold pressure
			should increase about 10 inches for each increase of 100 RPM. At 3,700
			 RPM the engine should be running at 140-150 inches of manifold pressure.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Anti-detonation Injection</strong></p>
			
			<p>One of the most serious complications you may encounter
			when racing the P-51 is engine overheating. Overheating can have 
			disastrous results, but the Flight Simulator P-51 has systems to 
			manage engine cooling.</p>
			
			<p>Uncontrolled detonation of the air-fuel mixture in one or more cylinders 
			is a direct result of high induction temperatures, which the ADI system 
			helps control. Detonation can damage pistons, rods, valves, and the 
			crankshaft. </p>
			
			<p>Detonation causes the engine to run rough and, if left unchecked 
			for more than a few seconds, the pistons are likely to be damaged, causing 
			an immediate reduction in engine power. The longer detonation
			 continues, the more seriously the pistons are damaged and the 
			  the greater the power loss.</p>
			 
			 <p>The Anti-detonation Injection (ADI) system sprays a 
			water and alcohol mixture into the intake, downstream of the 
			supercharger. As long as the ADI is on and there is 
			 ADI fluid available, induction temperature should remain within 
			 limits and detonation is deterred. However, if the manifold pressure 
			 is increased beyond 80 inches (ADI OFF) or 135 inches (ADI ON), the 
			 ADI may not be able to control induction temperatures.</p>
			 
			 <p>Use ADI whenever you boost manifold pressure beyond 80 inches. 
			 Be aware of overall engine oil and coolant system temperatures. 
			When running within engine limits (i.e. under RPM redline, assuming 
			there is no coolant leak) the engine should remain within normal temperature 
			limits.</p>

            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for 5,000 feet
            (1,524 meters). Approaching your cruising altitude,
            begin leveling off at about 50 feet (15 meters) below
            your target altitude.</p>

            <p>A typical power setting in the P-51 is 2,300 RPM
			and 38 inches of manifold pressure. 
            Cruise speed is about 265 mph.</p>

            <p>Remember that true airspeed is actually higher than
            indicated airspeed in thin, cold air. Experiment with
            power settings to find the setting that maintains the
            cruise speed and fuel consumption you want at the
            altitude that you choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with cruise power.
            A good rule for determining when to start your descent
            is the 3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand
            feet in altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the
            last three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            5,000 feet (1,524 meters) to sea level:<br>
            5,000 minus the last three zeros is 5.<br>
            5x3=15</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 15 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 300
            mph or less (it won't indicate this high
            until you descend into denser air) and a descent rate
            of approximately 500 feet per minute. A good power setting for
			descent is 30 inches of manifold pressure and 2,100 RPM.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>Approaches in the P-51 are basic. Enter downwind at
            150 mph with 20 degrees of flaps (use the joystick 
			throttle or press <strong>F2</strong>). Press <strong>G</strong> 
			to lower the landing gear.
            As you turn onto final, reduce your speed to 120 
            mph and lower the flaps to full.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Landing a taildragger requires a different technique
            than does landing a tricycle-gear airplane. The P-51 can
            be landed using either a wheel landing or a three-point
            landing technique. Some pilots feel the three-point
            landing is easier if the wind conditions are favorable,
            and with high winds, strong gusts, or a crosswind, a
            wheel landing is often easier. However, and this is important,
			a three-point landing in the P-51 makes it nearly impossible
			to see over the long nose.</p>
			
			<p>For a more thorough
            discussion of three-point vs. wheel landing, see
            <a href=
            "../AdvancedFlyingSkills/FlyingTaildraggers.htm">Flying
            a Taildragger</a>.</p> 
			
			<p>A key issue, however, is to keep the
            airplane aligned with the runway, in other words, to
            land straight. The center of gravity is behind the main
            wheels of a taildragger. If you're not straight when
            the wheels touch down the airplane's tail will try to
            swing around. Directional control is essential when
            maneuvering a taildragger on the ground so be prepared
            to work the rudders to stay straight.</p>

            <p>When doing a wheel landing in the P-51 raise the nose
            slightly to flare and slow the descent rate. You want
            to touch down as lightly on the main gear as possible at around
			90-95 mph.
            Once the P-51 mains are down, bring the power back to
            idle and apply a little nose-down or forward pressure
            on the elevator (push the joystick forward or press
            <strong>ARROW UP</strong>). 
			
			<p>Don't pull the stick back to lower
            the tail or you'll find yourself in the air again.
            Don't be too quick to use the brakes either, or the
            airplane will pitch over onto its nose. Let the
            airplane slow and the tail will begin to drop. Then
            hold some back pressure on the controls (hold the
            joystick aft or press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>).</p>

            <p>Apply the brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key) to
            slow to taxi speed, exit the runway, and taxi to
            parking. Don't be discouraged if you bounce the P-51
            when learning to land it. It takes a lot of practice to
            land it smoothly.</p>
