              Learn the elements of flight and flying
            </div><a name="TheFourForcesofFlight"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">The Four Forces of Flight</p>

            <p>Inventors and scientists struggled for centuries to
            understand the basic principles of flight, and experts
            still debate the details of aerodynamics. Pilots need
            to understand a few fundamental concepts, starting with
            the four forces that affect flight: lift, weight,
            thrust, and drag.</p>

            <p>These four forces act in pairs. <strong>Lift</strong> (the sum
            of all upward forces) opposes <strong>weight</strong> (the sum of
            all downward forces). Similarly, <strong>thrust</strong> (forward
            pulling force) opposes <strong>drag</strong> (rearward pulling
            force). The opposing forces balance one another in
            steady-state flight. Steady-state flight includes
            straight-and-level flight and constant-rate climbs or
            descents at steady airspeeds. You can assume that the
            four forces act through a single point called the
            center of gravity (CG).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lift</p>

            <p>Lift is the force that makes an airplane fly. Most
            of an airplane's lift comes from its wings. You control
            the amount of lift a wing creates by adjusting airspeed
            and angle of attack (AOA)&#8212;the angle at which the
            wing meets the oncoming air. In general, as an
            aircraft's airspeed or angle of attack increases, so
            does the amount of lift created by the wings. As an
            airplane's speed increases, you must reduce the angle
            of attack&#8212;lower the nose slightly&#8212;to
            maintain a constant altitude. As the airplane slows
            down, you must increase the angle of attack&#8212;raise
            the nose slightly&#8212;to generate more lift and
            maintain altitude.</p>

            <p>Remember that even in a climb or descent, lift
            essentially equals weight. An aircraft's rate of climb
            or descent is primarily related to the amount of thrust
            generated by its engines, not by the amount of lift
            created by its wings.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Weight</p>

            <p>Weight opposes lift. As a practical matter, you can
            assume that weight always acts along a line from the
            airplane's center of gravity to the center of the
            earth.</p>

            <p>At first you might assume that weight changes only
            as fuel is consumed. In fact, as an airplane maneuvers,
            it experiences variations in load factor, also known as
            G forces, which change the load supported by the wings.
            For example, an airplane making a level turn in a
            60-degree bank experiences a load factor of 2. If that
            airplane weighs 2,000 pounds (907 kg) at rest on the
            ground, its effective weight becomes 4,000 pounds
            (1,814 kg) during that turn.</p>

            <p>To maintain the balance between lift and weight
            during maneuvers, you must adjust the angle of attack.
            During a steeply banked turn, for example, you must
            raise the nose slightly (increase the angle of attack)
            to produce more lift and thus balance the increased
            weight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Thrust</p>

            <p>Thrust provided by an aircraft's power plant propels
            it through the air. Thrust is opposed by drag, and in
            steady-state flight, thrust and drag are equal. If you
            increase thrust and maintain altitude, thrust
            momentarily exceeds drag, and the airplane accelerates.
            Drag increases, too, however, and soon drag once again
            balances thrust. The airplane stops accelerating and
            resumes steady-state flight at a higher, but constant
            airspeed.</p>

            <p>Thrust is also the most important factor in
            determining your airplane's ability to climb. In fact,
            an airplane's maximum rate of climb is related not to
            the amount of lift its wings create, but to the amount
            of power available beyond that required to maintain
            level flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Drag</p>

            <p>Two kinds of drag affect an airplane. Parasite drag
            is friction between the air and an aircraft's
            structure&#8212;landing gear, struts, antennas, and so
            forth. Parasite drag increases as the square of an
            aircraft's velocity. If you double airspeed, parasite
            drag quadruples.</p>

            <p>Induced drag is a byproduct of lift. It is caused by
            air moving from the high-pressure area below a wing
            into the low-pressure area above the wing. This effect
            is most pronounced at slow airspeeds where a high angle
            of attack is necessary to produce enough lift to
            balance weight. In fact, induced drag varies inversely
            as the square of the airspeed. If you reduce airspeed
            by half, induced drag increases four times.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">A Balancing Act</p>

            <p>You can observe the relationship between the four
            forces by trying some experiments in Flight Simulator.
            Set up straight-and-level flight in the Cessna Skyhawk
            SP Model 172. Without moving the flight controls, add
            power. At first, airspeed increases, then the nose
            pitches up. Soon, however, the airplane stops
            accelerating and the airspeed returns to about its
            original value. Notice, however, that because you've
            added power, the airplane climbs at a steady rate.
            Reduce the power below the original setting, and the
            airspeed eventually settles near the original value,
            but the airplane descends at a steady rate.</p><a name=
            "TheAxesofFlight"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">The Axes of Flight</p>

            <p>Aircraft rotate around three axes: the longitudinal
            axis, the vertical axis, and the lateral axis. In an
            airplane, movement about each axis is controlled by one
            of the three primary control surfaces.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ailerons, Rudder, and Elevator</p>

            <p>Pilots use ailerons to bank or roll about the
            longitudinal axis. Rudder controls yaw about the
            vertical axis, and the elevator controls pitch about
            the lateral axis. The three axes intersect at the
            center of gravity. Smooth, coordinated use of controls
            separates pilots from airplane drivers. Good pilots use
            all the flight controls together to produce coordinated
            motion about the three axes.</p><a name=
            "StraightandLevelFlight"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Straight-and-Level Flight</p>

            <p>Flying straight and level may look simple, but it's
            actually one of the more difficult flight maneuvers to
            master. Because pilots want to control airplanes, they
            overdo it most of the time and interfere with the
            airplane's basic stability. Like a balancing act,
            straight-and-level flight requires that you make
            smooth, small corrections to keep the airplane from
            wobbling all over the sky.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Divide and Conquer</p>

            <p>It's best to break down the task of establishing and
            maintaining straight-and-level flight into two parts:
            Holding a constant altitude and airspeed. This part
            requires that the pairs of opposing forces&#8212;lift
            and weight, thrust and drag&#8212;remain balanced.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Holding a Constant Heading</p>

            <p>This part requires you to monitor the heading
            indicator and turn coordinator to hold the wings level,
            maintain coordinated flight, and correct minor
            deviations in heading.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Pitch + Power = Performance</p>

            <p>Fortunately, there's a simple rule that can help you
            handle the first task.</p>

            <p>The basic equation &quot;Pitch plus power equals
            performance&quot; is a pilot's golden rule. It means simply
            that if you establish a specific pitch attitude and set
            power at a constant level, the airplane will fly at a
            particular airspeed and either maintain level flight or
            climb or descend at a constant rate.</p>

            <p>For example, to set up a typical cruise
            configuration at 3,000 feet (915 m) in the Skyhawk SP,
            set the throttle to deliver about 2,500 rpm. To
            maintain level flight, adjust the pitch attitude so
            that the miniature airplane on the attitude indicator
            is level with the horizon. The top of the instrument
            panel is below the real horizon when you look out the
            front window.</p>

            <p>If you keep the nose from rising or falling and
            leave the power set at 2,500 RPM, the Skyhawk SP will
            maintain altitude and cruise at about 110 knots
            indicated airspeed.</p>

            <p>If the airplane starts to gain or lose altitude,
            make small, smooth corrections to the pitch attitude
            and adjust the elevator trim so eventually the airplane
            flies "hands off."</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Keeping It Straight</p>

            <p>Maintaining a constant heading is a little easier
            than holding altitude, but you still need to keep a
            close eye on the flight instruments. Check the heading
            indicator frequently to make sure the nose stays
            pointed in the right direction.</p>

            <p>Cross-check the turn coordinator: If the wings on
            its miniature airplane are level, the airplane isn't
            turning. If the wings aren't level, you need to apply
            smooth, slight pressure on the ailerons and rudder to
            level the wings and maintain coordinated
            flight.</p><a name="Turns"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Turns</p>

            <p>An airplane turns because some of the lift that the
            wings produce pulls it "around the corner," not because
            the rudder swings the nose left or right. In theory,
            you could skid an airplane through a turn with the
            rudder, but that's an inefficient (and uncomfortable)
            way to change direction. That's why airplanes bank to
            turn.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Horizontal Component of
            Lift</p>

            <p>Banking the wings with the ailerons deflects
            sideways some of the lift that the wings produce. This
            part of the airplane's total lift is called the
            horizontal component of lift. It's this force that
            pushes an airplane around in a turn.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Adverse Yaw</p>

            <p>Banking the wings changes the angle of attack of
            each wing. And the deflection of ailerons changes the
            drag of each wing. These two factors create a tendency
            for the airplane to yaw opposite the turn. That is, if
            you bank to the left, the airplane's nose tends to
            swing toward the right.</p>

            <p>To compensate for this effect, called "adverse yaw,"
            you must apply rudder pressure in the same direction as
            the turn. As you bank left, you should add a little
            left rudder, and vice-versa.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Loss of Lift</p>

            <p>Because some of the lift is deflected sideways in a
            turn, to maintain altitude you must increase the total
            lift that the wings produce. To increase lift, you must
            increase the angle of attack, so add a little
            up-elevator pressure (by pulling back on the stick) as
            you roll into a turn. The steeper the turn, the more
            up-elevator pressure you must add. In steeply banked
            turns of 45 degrees or more, you must add considerable
            up-elevator pressure (and probably add power, as well)
            to maintain altitude. Just remember to relax that back
            pressure on the stick as you roll out of the turn.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Turn Coordinator</p>

            <p>The turn coordinator is really two instruments. The
            gyro portion shows the aircraft's rate of
            turn&#8212;how fast it's changing direction. A ball in
            a tube called the &quot;inclinometer&quot; or &quot;slip/skid
            indicator&quot; shows the quality of the turn&#8212;whether
            the turn is "coordinated."</p>

            <p><strong>How It Works</strong><br>
            The gyro in the turn coordinator is usually mounted at
            a 30-degree angle. When the airplane turns, forces
            cause the gyro to precess. The rate of precession makes
            a miniature airplane on the face of the instrument bank
            left or right. The faster the turn, the greater the
            precession, and the steeper the bank of the miniature
            airplane.</p>

            <p><strong>Standard Rate Turn</strong><br>
            When the wings of the miniature airplane align with the
            small lines next to the "L" and "R," the aircraft is
            making a standard rate turn. For example, an aircraft
            with a standard rate turn of three degrees per second
            will complete a 360-degree turn in two minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>Balancing Act</strong><br>
            The black ball in the slip/skid indicator stays between
            the two vertical reference lines when the forces in a
            turn are balanced and the airplane is in coordinated
            flight. If the ball drops toward the inside of the
            turn, the airplane is slipping. If the ball moves
            toward the outside of the turn, the airplane is
            skidding.</p>

            <p>The auto-coordination feature in Flight Simulator
            automatically moves the rudder to maintain coordinated
            flight.</p><a name="Climbs"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climbs</p>

            <p>An airplane climbs when its engine or engines
            produce more power (thrust) than is required to
            maintain level flight at a particular weight and angle
            of attack. Airplanes do not climb because the wings
            generate more lift. This point may seem confusing, but
            it makes sense if you remember that whenever an
            airplane is in steady-state flight&#8212;for example, a
            climb at a constant airspeed and rate&#8212;lift equals
            weight. If lift exceeded weight during a climb, an
            airplane would accelerate upward.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">A Steady Pull</p>

            <p>During a steady-state climb, the component of lift
            acting vertically toward the ground is actually
            slightly less than weight, because when the airplane is
            in a climb attitude, some of the lift vector is
            directed rearward, not upward. So a climb is caused by
            the thrust vector pulling the airplane up at an angle.
            Imagine someone tugging a sled up a hill, and you'll
            get the general idea.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">More Power</p>

            <p>If power determines rate of climb, then it's
            apparent that the throttle, not the control yoke, is
            the primary "up-down" control in an airplane. Pulling
            back on the yoke to increase an airplane's pitch
            attitude usually does start a climb. But an increase in
            induced drag quickly counteracts the boost in lift, and
            the airplane, having gained a little altitude, settles
            into level flight at a lower airspeed or into a slow,
            constant-rate climb. To establish and maintain a steady
            rate of climb, excess thrust must be available, and you
            must add power.</p><a name="Descents"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descents</p>

            <p>Many people assume that to descend you simply push
            forward on the control yoke or stick to point the
            airplane's nose down. In fact, the pilot must adjust
            both pitch and power to establish a stable descent at a
            constant airspeed.</p>

            <p>You can descend with the airplane in a level or even
            nose-up attitude. Remember that if you hold an
            airplane's pitch attitude constant,
            thrust&#8212;power&#8212;determines whether the
            airplane maintains altitude, climbs, or descends. If
            the engine produces more thrust than is required to
            maintain level flight, the airplane climbs. It descends
            if you reduce power.</p>

            <p>As a rule of thumb, limit descents in unpressurized
            airplanes to about 500 feet per minute (152 m/min).
            This rate allows passenger's ears to adjust to pressure
            changes during the descent.</p>

            <p>Spend some time with the airplanes in Flight
            Simulator to familiarize yourself with the performance
            that you can expect at different power settings and
            airspeeds. Remember, the lower the power, the greater
            the rate of descent. Practice stopping a descent by
            smoothly adding power.</p><a name="HowWingsWork"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">How Wings Work</p>

            <p>Wings&#8212;not engines&#8212;are what make an
            airplane fly. Although wings come in many shapes, they
            all produce lift by splitting the oncoming air, called
            the relative wind. Air flowing under the wing maintains
            its ambient pressure. Air flowing over the curved upper
            surface accelerates, and due to several factors,
            including Bernoulli's principle, drops in pressure. The
            difference between the relatively high pressure below a
            wing and the relatively low pressure above creates a
            force, called lift. Deflection of the air downward from
            the bottom of the surface of the wing also contributes
            to the total lift that a wing produces. Pilots change a
            wing's lift by using the elevator to adjust the
            airplane's pitch attitude, and thus the wing's angle of
            attack.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Path vs. Pitch Attitude</p>

            <p>It's important to remember that the relative wind
            does not necessarily come from the direction in which
            the airplane's nose is pointed. To put it another way,
            angle of attack is not measured relative to the
            horizon. It's the angle between an airplane's flight
            path and its wings.</p><a name="Stalls"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Stalls</p>

            <p>A stall occurs when a wing reaches its critical
            angle of attack. Regardless of load factor, airspeed,
            bank angle, or atmospheric conditions, a wing always
            stalls at the same critical angle of attack. Pilots
            control angle of attack with the elevator.</p>

            <p>A stall is an aerodynamic phenomenon&#8212;it has
            nothing to do with an airplane's engine. Gliders,
            airliners, jet fighters, and prop-driven trainers all
            stall when their wings reach a specific angle of
            attack&#8212;not because their engines falter.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Anatomy of a Stall</p>

            <p>Up to a point, increasing the angle of attack
            increases the amount of lift a wing produces.
            Eventually, however, air flowing over the top of the
            wing can no longer follow the wing's contour and it
            begins to swirl like water flowing over rocks in a
            stream. At this point, called the critical angle of
            attack, total lift drops suddenly, and the wing
            stalls.</p>

            <p>Every wing has a specific critical angle of attack,
            and it always stalls at that angle. Most general
            aviation aircraft have wings with a critical angle of
            attack of about 15 degrees. Inexperienced pilots often
            mistake pitch attitude for angle of attack. Remember
            that the airplane's flight path (and therefore the
            relative wind) may not be in the direction that the
            nose of the airplane is pointing.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Warning Signs</p>

            <p>A slight shaking or buffeting often precedes a
            stall. This vibration begins as the air flowing over
            the top of the wing becomes turbulent. When this air
            hits the horizontal stabilizer and elevator you may
            feel a slight vibration in the stick. Most airplanes
            have a stall warning horn to alert you as the airplane
            approaches a stall.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Recovering from a Stall</p>

            <p>There is only one way to recover from a
            stall&#8212;reduce the angle of attack. Apply forward
            pressure on the stick to reduce the angle of attack,
            and add power to minimize loss of altitude.</p><a name=
            "CenterofGravity"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Center of Gravity</p>

            <p>The center of gravity (CG) is the point at which an
            airplane would hang in perfect balance if it were
            suspended by a cable. The CG is also the point at which
            the longitudinal, vertical, and lateral axes intersect
            and the point at which the four fundamental forces of
            flight&#8212;lift, weight, thrust, and drag&#8212;are
            assumed to act. . To ensure that an airplane is stable
            in flight and responds properly to control inputs, you
            must load your airplane carefully to keep the CG within
            its design range.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The CG Seesaw</p>

            <p>An empty airplane is like a seesaw: It balances on
            its center of gravity. Each item added to the airplane
            shifts the CG slightly. Objects placed forward of the
            original CG tend to tip the airplane forward. Objects
            placed behind the CG tend to tip it backward. The
            amount of tipping force, or "moment," depends on the
            weight of the object and its "arm"&#8212;the distance
            between the object and an arbitrary reference line
            called the datum. In many airplanes the datum is the
            firewall that separates the engine compartment from the
            cockpit.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Managing the CG</p>

            <p>Pilots manage the CG by controlling how weight is
            distributed in the aircraft cabin. In most small
            airplanes, the fuel tanks and seats are located close
            to the optimum CG, so the CG doesn't move much as fuel,
            people, and luggage are added. Nevertheless, before
            every flight a pilot must ensure that the CG of the
            loaded airplane falls between the forward and aft
            limits specified by the manufacturer.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The CG and Stability</p>

            <p>Keeping the CG within its design limits is critical
            because the position of the CG affects an airplane's
            stability, just as the position of a child on a seesaw
            changes the board's balance point.</p>

            <p>As the CG moves aft (toward the tail), an airplane
            becomes less stable in pitch. If the CG is too far aft,
            it may be impossible to lower the nose to recover from
            a stall.</p>

            <p>If the CG is too far forward, the airplane is &quot;nose
            heavy,&quot; making it difficult or impossible to flare
            during the final phase of landing.</p><a name=
            "Landings"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landings</p>

            <p>For most pilots, landing is the most challenging
            part of flying. The secret to a soft, smooth landing,
            odd as it sounds, is to try to keep the airplane from
            touching down too quickly. You can learn more about
