            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the King Air 350</p>

            <p>With more than 5,000 delivered, there is no other
            turbine-powered business aircraft that can match the
            success of the Beech King Air. At times, nearly 90
            percent of the cabin-class turboprops in the world have
            been King Airs. Designed as a turbine-powered
            alternative to the Queen Air, the King Air eventually
            supplanted the Queen Air as the number one choice in
            executive turboprops.</p>

            <p>The King Air in all its variants is a beautiful
            airplane with classic styling and graceful lines. Many
            of the improvements over the years have provided better
            aerodynamic efficiency, increased muscle under the
            cowlings, greater speed, upgraded avionics and
            electrical systems, and increased cabin luxury. In
            addition to duties as a corporate shuttle, the plane is
            also available in cargo configurations.</p>

            <p>A significant design change that would set the tone
            for future models in the line was the Model 200 Super
            King Air. A swept T-tail design was adopted, allowing
            the stabilizer and elevator to operate in relatively
            smooth, undisturbed air, out of the wing's downwash. It
            also gave the King Air a rakish new look. The length,
            wingspan, and power were increased, resulting in a
            greater useful load. The plane carried eight passengers
            in a pressurized cabin altitude of 6,740 feet at 25,000
            feet.</p>

            <p>Along with other improvements, Beech experimented
            with putting turbofan engines on the King Air. A test
            bed was flown with this modification, but the idea was
            never put into production.</p>

            <p>The latest derivative of the King Air is the Model
            350. With the most powerful engines on a King Air to
            date (1,050 shaft horsepower) and a fuselage 34 inches
            longer than the Model 300, the 350 sits at the pinnacle
            of a great lineage. It can seat up to 11 passengers in
            double-club chair arrangements that are standard in
            this plush airplane. A small galley and an in-flight
            entertainment system provide a level of comfort King
            Air customers have come to expect. Distinctive winglets
            are the most obvious external feature that make the 350
            easy to distinguish from its King Air siblings on the
            airport ramp.</p>

            <p>The entire King Air line is characterized by a great
            basic design that has only improved over the decades.
            It is a legend that continues to be a top pick for
            corporate flight operations. The King Air is a plane
            that richly deserves its regal moniker.</p>

            <p>The elegant King Air is a high-performance,
            pressurized-cabin, twin-engine, turboprop airplane.
            Most often employed as a corporate transport, it
            usually seats from 9 to 11 (although it's certified for
            up to 17 people). The structure is distinguished by its
            efficient wing and NASA-designed winglets. The T-tail
            on the Super King Airs was designed to provide improved
            aerodynamics, lighter control forces, and a wider
            center-of-gravity range.</p>

            <p>Many a young pilot has stepped up from more lowly
            positions to corporate flying in the right seat of a
            King Air. Piloting the beautiful Beech is a good
            transition toward the more complex world of turbine
            engines and larger aircraft.</p>
