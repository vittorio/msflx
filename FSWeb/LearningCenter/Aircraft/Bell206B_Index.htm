            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the JetRanger III</p>

            <p>The Bell 206 series has accumulated an astounding
            array of impressive statistics. More than 6,000
            JetRangers are flying worldwide in roles as diverse as
            corporate transportation, police surveillance, and
            United States Army aviation training. The series has
            flown over 26 million flight hours, and a few
            JetRangers are flying with more than 30,000 hours on
            their airframes.</p>

            <p>The JetRanger design was derived from a Light
            Observation Helicopter (LOH) proposal Bell submitted to
            the United States Army in the 1960s. Though it lost out
            to a Hughes Aircraft Company design, Bell decided to
            develop the model as the 206 for the civilian
            market.</p>

            <p>Despite Bell's best efforts, the original LOH design
            was found unsuitable for conversion to civilian use,
            primarily because of its limited carrying capacity.
            Engineers started over with an entirely new fuselage,
            resulting in an elegant teardrop-shaped aircraft that
            would seat five and carry their baggage, too.</p>

            <p>Due to rising costs of the Hughes helicopter, the
            LOH competition was reopened in 1967, and Bell's 206
            won this round. The 206 was purchased by the Army and
            put to work under the designation OH&#8211;58A.
            JetRangers are still serving in the armed forces. The
            newest model in uniform is the TH&#8211;67 Creek
            primary trainer. The United States Army credits a rise
            in student grades and a drop in course failures to the
            use of the Creek in training programs.</p>

            <p>It's as a civilian aircraft, however, that the
            JetRanger has seen its biggest success. The original
            206 has evolved into the JetRanger II and the JetRanger
            III, both incorporating major upgrades to more powerful
            engines.</p>

            <p>Although helicopters are inherently unstable and
            difficult to fly, testimony to the JetRanger's ease of
            handling is the fact that it can be certified for
            single-pilot IFR operation. In 1994, Texas businessman
            Ron Bower flew a Bell 206B JetRanger III solo around
            the world. Bower navigated across 21 countries and 24
            time zones in 24 days. By the end of the journey, he'd
            flown over 23,000 miles and had broken the previous
            around-the-world helicopter speed record by nearly five
            days.</p>

            <p>The JetRanger III costs less to operate and maintain
            than any other craft in its class and has the highest
            resale value of any light helicopter. A winning formula
            for safety and value has made the JetRanger the world's
            most popular helicopter series.</p>
