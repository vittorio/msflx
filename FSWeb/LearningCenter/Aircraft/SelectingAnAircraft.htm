            <p>The Flight Simulator fleet includes some of the most
            successful and popular aircraft in the
            world. Whether practicing instrument approaches,
            taking a scenic tour of the Greek isles, or landing on a helipad,
            there's an aircraft for every trip and every mood.</p>

            <p>You can find detailed information on all of the Flight Simulator
			aircraft in the Learning Center. Click <strong>Aircraft Information</strong> in the 
			Related Links box to the right.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can filter the <strong>Select Aircraft</strong> browser
			to limit the selection choices. Use the filters at the top of the 
			<strong>Select Aircraft</strong> dialog box.</p>
		
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Limit the list to a type like Single-engine Prop, Helicopter, or Commercial Airliner</strong>.<br><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Limit the list to only Cessna, Boeing, Airbus or another real-world aircraft manufacturer</strong>.<br> <strong>Publisher:</strong> Limit the list to only aircraft published by Microsoft or by another publisher if you have installed add-on aircraft. To learn more about add-ons for Flight Simulator, see the <strong>Add-ons</strong> section in <a href="../FlightSimExtreme/ExpandingYourHobby.htm">Expanding Your Hobby</a>.<br>

            <p>For each aircraft, you can change the airline call
            sign, flight number, and tail number used on the radio
            by the pilot and Air Traffic Control. You can also choose
			 whether to display the tail number on the 3-D model of the 
			 aircraft. Changing the
            airline call sign in the <strong>Details</strong> dialog box
            does not change the airline livery painted on the
            outside of the aircraft, but the entered tail number
            does appear on the tail of the aircraft.</p>

            <p>You can change the aircraft tail number to any
            combination of numbers and letters. The pilot and
            controller use the entire tail number during initial
            contact. The tail number is abbreviated to the last
            three characters of the call sign in subsequent
            contacts. If you always want to hear a short call sign
            (for example, if you never want to hear the "November"
            in U.S. call signs), create a short tail number.</p>
