            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day

            <p>Takeoff: 500 feet (152 meters), flaps 24 degrees, ISA conditions<br>Landing:
			 700 feet (213 meters), approach flaps</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 2,500 pounds (1,134 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: Sea level<br>
            Wind: No headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176; C<br>
            Runway: Hard surface</p>
			
			<p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in 
			better performance, as will having a headwind component.
			 Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade 
			 performance.</p><a name="Engine Startup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine will be running automatically when
            you begin a flight. If you shut the engine down, you
            can initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If you want to do the startup procedures
            manually, use the checklist on the
            Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Because the Maule is a taildragger, you may need to 
			raise the seat (press <strong>SHIFT+ENTER</strong>). While taxiing, the 
			power should be set at approximately 800 to 1,000 rpm. (Mixture 
			should be full forward.) As you move down the 
			taxiway, use the rudder to turn the nose right and left for 
			directional control. (Twist the joystick; use the rudder pedals;
			 or press <strong>0</strong> or <strong>ENTER</strong> on the 
			 numeric keyboard to turn left or right respectively.)</p>
			 
			 <p>If taxiing and taking off on snow, be sure to lower the skis. If 
			 taxiing and taking off on pavement or any hard surface, 
			 be sure to raise the skis (press <strong>G</strong>).</p><a name="Flaps"></a>
			
			 <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>For a normal takeoff, Maule recommends 0 to 24 degrees
			 of flaps (at the pilot's discretion). The range of flap 
			 settings is from -7 (cruise flaps) to 48 degrees.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist found in
            the Kneeboard (<strong>F10</strong>). Set flaps (press <strong>F7</strong>,
            or click the flaps lever) between 0 and 24 degrees,
            depending on the runway, temperature, and wind.</p>

            <p>The Maule has very impressive takeoff performance. 
			Align the aircraft with the runway centerline, and 
			advance the throttle control to full power (use the 
			joystick throttle, or press <strong>F4</strong>). The tail will come up 
			at around 30 mph (26 knots). At 55 mph (48 knots), gently 
			pull back on the controls.</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Climb at approximately 80-90 mph (70-78 knots) until
			 reaching cruising altitude. Above 3,000 feet, lean the 
			 mixture for smooth operation and for maximum rpm.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section. However, a good rule to bear 
			in mind is that an airplane with a normally aspirated engine
			 is most efficient between 6,000-8,000 feet. That altitude 
			 range gives the best tradeoff between available power, 
			 fuel economy, and true airspeed.</p>

            <p>Typical cruise settings for the Maule are 22" Hg and
			 2,200 RPM. At a cruise speed of 140 mph (122 knots) the 
			 Maule will burn about 14 gallons of fuel per hour. When 
			 above 3,000 feet, lean the mixture for optimum performance.

			  "..\InTheCockpit\ControllingTheEngine.htm">Controlling the Engine</a>.)
			  </p><a name="Descent and Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent and Approach</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. A good rule for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            10,000 feet (3,048 meters) to sea level:<br>
            10,000 minus the last three zeros is 10.<br>
            10 x 3=30</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 30 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 135
            mph (103 knots; it may not indicate this high until you
            descend into denser air) and a descent rate of 500 feet
            per minute. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>
			
			<p>In the Maule, adjust power during descent to maintain
			 135 mph (use the joystick throttle or press <strong>F2</strong> to decrease
			  thrust or <strong>F3</strong> to increase thrust). The propeller lever 
			  should remain at 2,000 rpm.</p>
			  
			  <p>On approach, reduce power and set the airplane up for a descent 
			  rate of approximately 450 feet per minute. Plan to fly 
			  at 75-80 mph on downwind.</p>
			  
			  <p>If landing on snow, be sure to lower the skis. If landing on
			  pavement or any hard surface, be sure to raise the skis (press
			  <strong>G</strong>).</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>On final approach, plan for a landing speed of 65
            mph with full flaps. Plan to land slightly
            tail-low.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, bring the power back to idle, gently
            lower the nosewheel, and lightly apply the brakes by
            pressing the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key.</p>
