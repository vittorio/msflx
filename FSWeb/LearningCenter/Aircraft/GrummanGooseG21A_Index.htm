            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the G&#8211;21A Goose</p>

            <p>Sometimes an aircraft design is so right, so attuned to 
			a special set of tasks that it flies on long after the production 
			line shuts down. The Grumman Goose is that kind of plane, 
			and the story of aviation in Alaska and western Canada would 
			not be the same if this sturdy flying boat had never gotten 
			off Grumman's drawing board.</p>

            <p>Rugged, roomy, powerful, and above all amphibian, the 
			Goose can go anywhere. Its boat hull and retractable landing 
			gear provide the ability to take off from and land on a runway 
			or the water, so the Goose can get to places most aircraft 
			can't. Manufactured by Grumman Aeronautical Engineering Co., 
			whose sturdy World War II combat aircraft earned the company 
			its "Grumman Iron Works" reputation, the Goose is built like 
			a battleship-or a tank. It can handle heavy loads, take a lot 
			of punishment, and still operate economically. Its twin radial 
			engines, mounted high on the wing to keep them relatively dry 
			while maneuvering on the water, give it the kind of reliability 
			that made naval aviators feel safe flying over the vast expanses 
			of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <p>The Goose was designed during the heyday of the flying boat 
			in the late 1930s, when big, luxurious four-engined Boeing, 
			Sikorsky, and Martin "Clippers" provided the well-heeled a 
			glamorous means of travel to exotic locales. The more modestly 
			scaled Goose-initially intended as a transport for wealthy Long 
			Island businessmen-first flew in 1937. It soon caught the eye of 
			the U.S. Navy, which eventually acquired two-thirds of its entire 
			production. Originally designed to carry six passengers in luxury 
			comparable to the big Clippers, the Goose became a Navy utility 
			transport-a workhorse that could get people and equipment into and 
			out of remote areas. From people and parts hauling to target towing 
			to antisubmarine patrol with bombs and depth charges, the Goose 
			did it all.</p>

            <p>With the end of World War II, the big flying boats vanished 
			from the world aviation scene. The biggest of them-Howard Hughes' 
			gigantic eight-engined "Spruce Goose"-flew just one mile before 
			disappearing from public view in 1947. The Grumman Goose, on the 
			other hand, has never fallen out of favor wherever people need 
			transport to coastal and island locations. Forty of the 345 Gooses 
			built by Grumman between 1937 and 1945 are still flying; some have 
			even been converted from piston to turbine power. Thirty-four more 
			are in museum collections, or being rebuilt or restored.</p>

            <p>In this era of mass transit air travel, the Goose is an honest, 
			old-fashioned aircraft that's easy to love, and one that, after 
			seventy years of service, still transports people and goods to places 
			few modern aircraft can.</p>
