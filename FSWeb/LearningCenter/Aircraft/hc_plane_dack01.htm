          <p>The rain is pounding on the fuselage above my head and
          whipping across the windscreen in front of me, almost
          drowning out the deep, steady thrum of the
          1,000-horsepower radial engine on the sturdy aluminum
          wing stretching out to my left. The hydraulic windshield
          wiper makes a feeble attempt to move the water off the
          narrow, rectangular pane of glass that sits just a foot
          in front of my eyes, but it seems a losing battle. Randy,
          the plane's copilot, finally just fixes the wipers at an
          upward angle to deflect the water away from a small piece
          of the front window.</p>

          <p>"Seems to work better that way," he says with his
          matter-of-fact Arkansas twang.</p>

          <p>Arkansas, however, is a long way from the cockpit of
          our 1948 Douglas DC&#8211;3 as we plow through the low
          clouds and drenching rain of Alaska's rugged southeast
          coastline. At 400 feet above the water, we're still only
          couple of hundred feet or so below the ragged cloud deck,
          and whenever we fly through the intense rainshowers that
          erupt along our course, the visibility worsens. We
          navigate by coastline, keeping the breakers 100 yards or
          so to our left as we fly south. As long as we're over the
          water, we won't hit anything, and as long as we keep the
          shoreline in sight, we won't get lost.</p>

          <p>I reach up and stuff a new paper towel in the crack
          between two of the three panes of glass that make up my
          half of the windscreen. The one I put in there half an
          hour ago is soaked, and water is dripping steadily on my
          right leg. I begin to understand why Douglas issued a
          part number for rain capes to protect DC&#8211;3 pilots
          from the elements that routinely leaked through the
          cockpit windows. I take another towel and make a vain
          attempt to dry off the radios, which are suffering the
          same fate as my leg.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;From where I sit, crammed right up against the
              windscreen, I can see only the first two feet of the
              plane's stubby nose...&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>This isn't a trip anyone would take for fun, but we're
          not here for a joyride. I've been invited to fly along
          with this DC&#8211;3's crew for a week to experience the
          life of a working cargo pilot in Alaska, and so far, my
          assessment is that it's pretty hard work. Stacked in the
          cavernous cabin behind us are tubs carrying 7,500 pounds
          of fresh salmon that we're hauling from the small fishing
          town of Yakutat to the fish packing plant in Sitka. Most
          sixty-year-old airplanes have long since been relegated
          to weekend leisure flights or museums. But the venerable
          DC&#8211;3 is still valued as an active member of the
          working aircraft community, for the same reasons it was
          so popular when it first flew in 1935: it carries a good
          load a good distance, can operate out of short or rough
          fields, and is economical enough that its operators can
          make a profit.</p>

          <p>The DC&#8211;3 is not a glamorous or superb-handling
          airplane. It doesn't fly as much as lumber along our
          course&#8212;big, heavy, ponderous, and impervious to the
          little bumps and gusts that would unsettle a smaller
          plane in the unstable air currents beneath and in the
          clouds. From where I sit, crammed right up against the
          windscreen, I can see only the first two feet of the
          plane's stubby nose, making it difficult to judge whether
          the plane is level, climbing, or descending without
          frequent checks on the instruments. The plane doesn't
          respond quickly to any input&#8212;turns require two
          hands on the circular yoke-topped control column and an
          aggressive amount of rudder pressure&#8212;but it feels
          stable as a barge and strong as a bridge. Which is pretty
          much what the DC&#8211;3 is: a strong, aerial barge.</p>

          <p>The DC&#8211;3 evolved out of a request by
          Transcontinental and Western Air (which later became
          Trans World Airlines, or TWA) in 1932 for an all-metal
          monoplane capable of carrying 12 passengers at least
          1,080 miles at a speed of at least 145 mph. TWA had
          suffered a huge publicity setback in March of 1931, when
          Notre Dame's famous football coach Knute Rockne was
          killed in the crash of one of TWA's wood-wing Fokker
          trimotor planes. So TWA also required that this new
          design be able to take off and fly from any point along
          its transcontinental route on only one engine.</p>

          <p>TWA originally had planned to simply buy a number of
          The Boeing Company's new Model 247 airliners. But Boeing
          owned United Airlines, a competitor to Transcontinental.
          So Boeing refused to sell TWA any of its planes. As a
          result, TWA approached the Douglas Aircraft Company, and
          the rest is history. The first model Douglas built in
          response to Transcontinental's request was the DC&#8211;1
          (for "Douglas Commercial, First Model"). But it quickly
          evolved into the DC&#8211;2, and then the bigger,
          21-passenger DC&#8211;3, which flew for the first time on
          December 17, 1935&#8212;the 32nd anniversary of the
          Wright brothers' first successful powered flight. The
          DC&#8211;3 represented a significant step forward in
          aircraft design, with a monocoque-fuselage construction,
          engines smoothly cowled and faired into the wing,
          controllable-pitch propellers, and hydraulically powered
          flaps and retractable landing gear. It could also cruise
          at almost 190 mph.</p>

          <p>The DC&#8211;3 came along at a crucial time for the
          struggling, infant airlines. Up until 1934, the numerous
          airlines that had popped up around the country had made a
          profit only with the help of government airmail subsidies
          that supplemented the income provided by fare-paying
          passengers. But in 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt
          cancelled all the commercial airmail contracts, assigning
          the task of flying the mail to the Army Air Corps. The
          airmail contracts were eventually returned to the
          commercial sector, but relying on airmail subsidies was
          clearly a risky business. The DC&#8211;3 very quickly
          became the hero and choice of every airline because it
          was the first airplane ever built to offer the right
          balance of efficiency, range, speed and payload to make
          money just by carrying passengers.</p>

          <p>When the DC&#8211;3 first came out, it was a luxury
          airliner, with modern amenities such as cabin heat,
          insulated walls, and running water in the on-board
          lavatory. It was built in three versions: a 21-seat
          dayliner; a 14-passenger "Skysleeper," which incorporated
          bunks for passengers to sleep in during the all-night
          coast-to-coast trip; and an even tonier, 14-passenger
          "Skylounge" for day passengers willing to pay extra for
          ultraluxurious, executive comfort. Today, First Class
          passengers sit in the forward section of an airliner.
          Back then, they sat in an entirely different plane.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;There's a steady rhythm to the sound of the engines
              and a sturdy feel to every knob...It has the feel of
              a machine you could trust to bring you home...&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>The DC&#8211;3 was the classic of all early airliners;
          the Grand Dame of not just an industry, but an era. It
          was in DC&#8211;2s and DC&#8211;3s that pilot and author
          Ernest Gann accumulated most of the adventures he
          chronicled in his famous tale, Fate is the Hunter. The
          DC&#8211;3 was also one of the planes that opened up the
          Alaskan wilderness to airline travel. In fact, one of the
          first Alaskan airline routes ran along this very
          coastline I'm now traveling between Anchorage, Alaska and
          Seattle, Washington. And as we work our way through the
          low clouds, rain, and wild, unspoiled terrain en route to
          Sitka and Seattle, I feel a close kinship with Gann, his
          colleagues, and all those Alaskan DC&#8211;3 pilots, for
          flying in Alaska has changed little in 60 years. Since
          the mountainous terrain makes low-altitude radar coverage
          impossible, pilots still rely on verbal position reports
          to help stay separated from each other. Even radio
          communication and navigation are limited, except for
          global positioning system (GPS) signals received from
          satellites. We are virtually alone in our ship over the
          sea, relying on her enduring strength and stability to
          get us through the storms that lie in our path.</p>

          <p>The strong, steady feel of the plane reverberates
          through the control cables that link the movements of my
          hands and feet to the ailerons, elevator and rudder
          controls at the other extremes of the plane's span and
          length. Sitting at the very tippy-tippy front end of this
          27,000-pound airplane, it feels odd to kick the rudder
          pedals and suddenly become aware of how much mass is
          moving behind me. I'm accustomed to sitting much closer
          to the center of gravity in a plane, and flying the
          DC&#8211;3 almost makes me feel as if I'm sitting on a
          child's play car with my knees scrunched up around the
          steering wheel. But there's a steady rhythm to the sound
          of the engines and a sturdy feel to every knob, control
          lever, and piece of metal in both the cockpit and the
          airplane. It has the feel of a machine you could trust to
          bring you home, even with a load of ice on the wings, an
          engine out, or other problems or damage that might down a
          less robust transport.</p>

          <p>That reliable strength, as well as its inherent power
          and payload, made the DC&#8211;3 a legend, and accounts
          for its many lives and enduring roles. For although the
          DC&#8211;3 started life as an airliner, it was as a
          multipurpose cargo plane that it achieved its greatest
          and longest-lasting fame. Within three years after the
          DC&#8211;3 entered service with American Airlines, war
          was looming in Asia and Europe, and by 1941 all
          commercial aircraft production in the United States
          ceased for the duration of World War II. Airliners were
          pressed into duty as troop carriers and transports, and
          the C&#8211;47, as the military version of the DC&#8211;3
          was called, became one of the most widely used and
          recognized planes of the war. Almost 10,000 C&#8211;47s
          were built during the war, and there is scarcely a
          78-year-old American male alive today who wouldn't
          recognize the distinctive shape of the C&#8211;47 &quot;Gooney
          Bird.&quot; He would have seen it pass by overhead bringing
          supplies to the front lines, flown in one as he traveled
          to or from the war, or possibly even jumped out of
          one.</p>

          <p>The C&#8211;47 was also used extensively to fly
          supplies over the infamous "Hump" between China and the
          sea ports in Burma during WWII after the Japanese closed
          the Indochina road. The airlift over the mountainous
          region separating China from the Bay of Bengal was a
          crucial lifeline, but it involved extremely hazardous
          flying, especially for the lower-flying C&#8211;47s. The
          bigger, pressurized Curtiss C&#8211;46s could fly over
          most of the mountains and weather, but C&#8211;47 pilots
          often had to fly through the mountain passes, in the
          clouds, carefully timing each leg to judge when to make
          the next prescribed heading change to avoid hitting the
          mountainsides. Needless to say, the casualty rate for
          pilots flying the Hump was high.</p>

          <p>But like the B&#8211;52 bomber, which is still flying
          with third-generation B&#8211;52 pilots at the controls,
          the C&#8211;47 proved so well suited to its particular
          role that it continued to be used for military purposes
          even after WWII ended. It saw service in the Berlin
          Airlift and both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In
          various places around the world, it has been used as a
          gunship, a troop carrier, a reconnaissance and rescue
          vehicle, and a supply ship of legendary ability, even
          carrying oversized cargo strapped to the underside of its
          fuselage when the need dictated.</p>

          <p>When WWII came to an end, however, the DC&#8211;3's
          days as an airliner were numbered. The more capable,
          tricycle-gear DC&#8211;4 and the faster, pressurized
          Boeing Stratoliner and Lockheed Constellation had been
          designed before the United States entered WWII, so
          Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed all brought better, faster
          airliners to market very soon after the government lifted
          the wartime ban on commercial aircraft building. There
          were some small airlines that kept operating DC&#8211;3s
          throughout the 1950s, '60s, '70s and even 1980s, for the
          simple reason that the planes could still make money,
          especially for small companies operating on short routes.
          By the time Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA) finally
          retired one of its DC&#8211;3s in the mid-1980s, the
          plane had accumulated over 90,000 flight hours. There
          were a number of C&#8211;47s and DC&#8211;3s converted to
          executive use, as well.</p>

          <p>But although other planes could provide executive
          comfort and meet the needs of small airlines, nothing
          else could perform the DC&#8211;3's role as a cargo ship
          quite as well as the original. There were bigger planes,
          and planes that could land as well in short or rough
          strips, but no other plane could carry the same
          combination of weight and volume as economically as the
          DC&#8211;3. The DC&#8211;3 could carry between 7,500 and
          12,900 pounds, depending on the model, and yet could
          still operate out of rough strips only a couple of
          thousand feet long.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;The fishermen still stand in a cluster along the
              runway, waving to us as we dip our wing and head off
              to the west.&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>"DC&#8211;3s have kept Alaska rolling," an Alaskan
          fisherman tells me. Indeed, there are few roads in
          Alaska, which means that even along the coast, all
          supplies must be brought in by barge or plane. And for
          more than half a century, the DC&#8211;3 has been a key
          player in keeping those supply lines open. So to
          residents of remote Alaskan towns, the sound of a
          DC&#8211;3's round engines approaching through the fog
          and clouds represents far more than a whiff of nostalgia.
          It represents a critical and still-intact link with the
          outside world. But that only partially accounts for the
          loyalty the locals seem to feel toward this old cargo
          plane.</p>

          <p>&quot;I think we all love the DC&#8211;3s because they
          reflect the same qualities we like to think we have,&quot; a
          woman in Yakutat explains, with warm affection in her
          voice. &quot;They're tough, dependable, versatile, and
          strong.&quot;</p>

          <p>The DC&#8211;3 is not a particularly sexy or
          spectacular-handling airplane. It's heavy on the
          controls, slow to respond, and it can be a handful in a
          crosswind. And although the DC&#8211;3 I flew in Alaska
          might have started out as an airliner, it's hard to
          discern any trace of its upper-crust past in the barren,
          utilitarian trappings it now wears as a working cargo
          hauler.</p>

          <p>As we land to pick up our last load of fish along the
          Alsek River, I climb out of the cockpit and walk down the
          sloping wood-plank floor of the cabin toward the big
          double-cargo door at the rear of the plane. My footsteps
          echo and I have to be careful not to trip on the metal
          tie-down strips bolted down along the sides of the
          floorboards. This is, without a doubt, a working-class
          airplane. But while she may have lost her fancy clothing,
          there is still an elegance and stature about her that
          commands respect. She has done an honest day's work
          through the chill of winter and blazing heat of summer
          for more than 60 years, and she still can be relied on to
          deliver her cargo on time and bring her crews safely home
          again.</p>

          <p>We load and tie down our 7,000-pound cargo of Coho
          salmon&#8212;the final load for the season&#8212;stow the
          metal steps, close the cargo door, and get ready to fire
          up the engines. The fishermen stand in a cluster off to
          one side. They watch silently, almost reverently, as the
          propeller blades turn over, nine blades on each side,
          before Randy edges the mixture forward and, with a
          rumbling, staccato explosion and a distinctive puff of
          smoke, each engine comes to life in turn. The fishermen's
          lingering, respectful presence is itself a tribute;
          homage paid to a tribal elder whose experience and
          accomplishments have earned her a place of honor among
          those she serves.</p>

          <p>We taxi out to the gravel runway, a slow process of
          S-turns and sharp jolts on the brakes as we swerve
          abruptly back and forth to avoid hitting the trees on
          each side of the narrow grass and gravel road. We taxi to
          the end of the strip and push the throttles forward,
          listening to the stuttering crescendo of the two Pratt
          &amp; Whitney radial engines climbing to full power
          before we release the brakes and start lumbering
          awkwardly down the runway. We bounce twice and then,
          finally, as we approach the trees at the far end of the
          strip, lift slowly and heavily into the air. The
          fishermen still stand in a cluster along the runway,
          waving to us as we dip our wing and head off to the
          west.</p>

          <p>The day may come, of course, when the last working
          DC&#8211;3 is finally retired. Even in Alaska, times are
          changing, and turbine-powered Caravans and SkyVans are
          starting to take over roles once dominated by the
          DC&#8211;3. But there's also a company in Wisconsin
          that's doing a booming business mating old DC&#8211;3
          airframes with new turboprop engines, so who knows? The
          ubiquitous DC&#8211;3 may have quite a few years, roles,
          and adventures left in her yet. As I watch the Alsek
          Glacier retreat into the distance behind a weathered,
          sturdy wing turned bronze by the light of the northern
          setting sun, I can't help but hope that she does.</p>
