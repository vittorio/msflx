            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Maximum taxi weight is 853,000 pounds (386,913
            kilograms).</p>

            <p>Reverse thrust is forbidden for backing the
            747&#8211;400 out of parking or at any time during
            taxiing.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The &#8211;400's response to thrust change is
              slow, particularly at high gross weights. Idle thrust
              is adequate for taxiing under most conditions, but
              you'll need a slightly higher thrust setting to get
              the aircraft rolling. Allow time for a response after
              each thrust change before changing the thrust setting
              again.</li>

              <li>The &#8211;400 has a ground speed indication on
              the HSI. Normal straight taxi speed should not exceed
              20 knots. For turns, 8 to 12 knots are good for dry
              surfaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, rudder pedals (twist the
            joystick, use the rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong>
            [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the numeric keypad)
            are used for directional control during taxiing. Avoid
            stopping the 747 during turns, as excessive thrust is
            required to get moving again.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p>The following table lists recommended maneuvering
            speeds for various flap settings. The minimum
            flap-retraction altitude is 400 feet, but 1,000 feet
            complies with most noise abatement procedures. When
            extending or retracting the flaps, use the next
            appropriate flap setting depending on whether you're
            slowing down or speeding up.</p>

            <p>Remember, these are minimum speeds for flap
            operation. Flying slower than this at bank angles of 40
            degrees would initiate the stick shaker. For VFE
            speeds, see the Kneeboard. Adding 15 to 20 knots to
            these speeds is recommended if maneuvering with large
            bank angles, and in general, provides a good safety
            margin. On climbout, lowering the nose to give an
            additional 15 to 20 knots will also give you better
            forward vision from the cockpit.</p>

            <p>In adverse weather conditions, taxi with the wing
            flaps up, and then set takeoff flaps during your Before
            Takeoff checklist procedure. Likewise, retract the
            flaps as soon as practicable upon landing.</p>

            <p>Flaps are generally not used on the 747&#8211;400 to
            increase the descent rate during the descent from en
            route altitude. Normal descents are made in the clean
            configuration to pattern or Initial Approach Point
            (IAP) altitude.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>All of the following occurs quite rapidly. Read
            through the procedure several times before attempting
            it in the plane so you know what to expect.</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist, and set
            flaps to 5 (press <strong>F7</strong>, or click the flap lever on
            the panel).</p>

            <p>With the aircraft aligned with the runway
            centerline, advance the throttles (press <strong>F3</strong>, or
            drag the throttle levers) to approximately 40 percent
            N1. This allows the engines to spool up to a point
            where uniform acceleration to takeoff thrust will occur
            on both engines. The exact amount of initial setting is
            not as important as setting symmetrical thrust.</p>

            <p>As the engines stabilize (this occurs quickly),
            advance the thrust levers to takeoff thrust&#8212;less
            than or equal to 100 percent N1. Final takeoff thrust
            should be set by the time the aircraft reaches 60 KIAS.
            Directional control is maintained by use of the rudder
            pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder pedals, or
            press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the
            numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>Below about 80 KIAS, it's easy to stop the airplane
            on the runway using the brakes only.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>V1, approximately 159 KIAS, is decision speed.
              Above V1, you probably won't be able to stop the
              airplane on the runway after an engine failure or
              other problem.</li>

              <li>At Vr, approximately 177 KIAS, smoothly pull the
              stick (or yoke) back to raise the nose to 10 degrees
              above the horizon. Hold this pitch attitude and be
              careful not to over-rotate (doing so before liftoff
              could cause a tail strike).</li>

              <li>At V2, approximately 188 KIAS, the aircraft has
              reached its takeoff safety speed. This is the minimum
              safe flying speed if an engine fails. Hold this speed
              until you get a positive rate of climb.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude
            are increasing), retract the landing gear (press
            <strong>G</strong>, or drag the landing gear lever). The aircraft
            will quickly accelerate to V2+15.</p>

            <p>At 1,000 feet (305 meters), reduce flaps from 5 to 1
            (press <strong>F6</strong>, or drag the flaps lever). Continue
            accelerating to 200 KIAS, at which point you can go to
            flaps up (press <strong>F6</strong> again).</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>As you retract the flaps, set climb power to
            approximately 90 percent N1 (press <strong>F2</strong>, use the
            throttle control on your joystick, or drag the thrust
            levers). Maintain 6- or 7-degrees nose-up pitch
            attitude to climb at 250 KIAS to 10,000 feet, then 340
            knots to 25,000 feet, then 0.84 Mach to cruise
            altitude.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally determined by winds,
            weather, and other factors. You might want to use these
            factors in your flight planning if you have created
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for FL350.
            Approaching your cruising altitude, take 10 percent of
            the rate of climb or descent, and convert that number
            to feet. For example, if you're climbing or descending
            at 1000 FPM, start leveling off 100 ft before you reach
            the target altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the Boeing
            747&#8211;400 in climb, cruise, and descent if you use
            the autopilot. The autopilot can hold the altitude,
            speed, vertical speed, heading, or navaid course you
            specify. For more information about using autopilots,
            see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingAnAutopilot.htm">Using an
            Autopilot</a></p>

            <p>Normal cruise speed is Mach 0.85. You can set .85 in
            the autopilot Mach hold window and engage the Hold
            button (click the Mach button). Set the A/T Arm (click
            the switch to engage the autothrottles), and the
            autothrottles will set power at the proper percent to
            maintain this cruise speed. The changeover from
            indicated airspeed to Mach number typically occurs as
            you climb to altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000
            to 9,000 meters).</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher than your indicated airspeed in the thin, cold
            air. You'll have to experiment with power settings to
            find the setting that maintains the cruise speed you
            want at the altitude you choose.</p><a name=
            "Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done using idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            35,000 feet (10,668 meters) to sea level:<br>
            35,000 minus the last three zeros is 35.<br>
            35 x 3=105.</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 105
            nautical miles from your destination, maintaining a
            speed of 250 KIAS (about 45 percent N1) and a descent
            rate of 1,500 to 2,000 feet per minute, with thrust set
            at idle. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>To descend, disengage the autopilot if you turned it
            on during cruise, or set the airspeed or vertical speed
            into the autopilot and let it do the flying for you.
            Reduce power to idle, and lower the nose slightly. The
            747&#8211;400 is sensitive to pitch, so ease the nose
            down just a degree or two. Remember not to exceed the
            regulation speed limit of 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). Continue this profile down to the
            beginning of the approach phase of flight.</p>

            <p>Deviations from the above can result in arriving too
            high at the destination (requiring circling to descend)
            or arriving too low and far out (requiring expenditure
            of extra time and fuel). Plan to have an initial
            approach fix regardless of whether or not you're flying
            an instrument approach.</p>

            <p>It takes about 35 seconds and three miles (5.5
            kilometers) to decelerate from 290 KIAS to 250 KIAS in
            level flight without speed brakes. It takes another 35
            seconds to slow to 210 KIAS. Plan to arrive at
            traffic-pattern altitude at the flaps-up maneuvering
            speed about 12 miles out when landing straight-in, or
            about eight miles out when entering a downwind
            approach. A good crosscheck is to be at 10,000 ft AGL
            (3,048 meters) 30 miles (55.5 kilometers) from the
            airport at 250 KIAS.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>The 747&#8211;400 won't slow down quickly just
            because you throw the gear and flaps down. Have your
            aircraft configuration (flaps and landing gear) set and
            your target speed hit well in advance. Excess speed in
            the &#8211;400 will require a level flight segment to
            slow down.</p>

            <p>If you're high coming into the approach, you can use
            the speed brakes to increase descent. If possible,
            <strong>avoid using the speed brakes to increase descent
            when wing flaps are extended</strong>. Do not use speed
            brakes below 1,000 feet AGL.</p>

            <p>On an instrument approach, be configured for landing
            and have your speed nailed by the final approach fix
            (where you intercept the glide slope), usually about
            five miles from touchdown.</p>

            <p>Set flaps to 1 (press <strong>F7</strong>, or drag the flaps
            indicator or lever) when airspeed is reduced below the
            minimum flaps-up maneuvering speed. Normally, this
            would be when entering the downwind leg or at the
            initial approach fix, so you should be at the desired
            airspeed by this point. You can then continue adding
            flaps as you get down to the speed limits for each
            setting.</p>

            <p>Flaps 30 is the setting for normal landings. At
            flaps 40, which is used for short runways, the aircraft
            settles rapidly once you chop the power.</p>

            <p>When the glide slope comes alive, extend the landing
            gear (press <strong>G</strong>, or drag the landing gear
            lever).</p>

            <p>The proper final approach speed varies with weight,
            but a good target speed at typical operating weight is
            135 to 140 KIAS.</p>

            <p>With landing gear down and flaps at 30 degrees, set
            the power at 55 to 60 percent N1. This configuration
            should hold airspeed with a good descent angle toward
            the runway. Use small power adjustments and pitch
            changes to stay on the glidepath. You're looking for a
            descent rate of about 700 fpm.</p>

            <p>Prior to landing, make sure the speed brake handle
            is in the ARM position.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Maximum landing weight is 630,000 pounds. Select a
            point about 1,000 feet (305 meters) past the runway
            threshold, and aim for it. Adjust your pitch so that
            the point remains stationary in your view out the
            windscreen.</p>

            <p>As the threshold goes out of sight beneath you,
            shift the visual sighting point to about &#190; down
            the runway. When the aircraft's main wheels are about
            15 feet (4.5 meters) above the runway, initiate a flare
            by raising the nose about 3 degrees. Move the thrust
            levers to idle, and fly the airplane onto the
            runway.</p>

            <p>To assure adequate aft fuselage clearance on
            landing, fly the airplane onto the runway at the
            desired touchdown point. DO NOT hold the airplane off
            the runway for a soft landing.</p>

            <p>Set the autobrakes before landing. When the main
            gear touch down, apply brakes smoothly (press the
            <strong>PERIOD</strong> key or <strong>Button 1</strong>&#8212;typically
            the trigger&#8212;on the joystick).</p>

            <p>If you armed the spoilers, they will deploy
            automatically. If not, move the brake lever into the UP
            position now. Add reverse thrust (press <strong>F2</strong>, or
            drag the thrust levers into reverse). Make sure you
            come out of reverse thrust when airspeed drops below 60
            knots.</p>

            <p>Retract the flaps (press <strong>F6</strong>, or drag the
            flaps lever), and lower the spoilers (press
            <strong>SLASH</strong> [ / ], or click the brake lever) as you
            taxi to the terminal.</p>
