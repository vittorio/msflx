              Weight and balance and getting there with enough gas
            </div>

            <p>Fuel plays an important part in preflight planning.
            Aside from the fact that you need enough fuel to reach
            your destination, fuel also contributes to the weight
            carried by the airplane.</p>

            <p>If you think that only an aeronautical engineer
            would find the weight and balance of an airplane
            interesting, read some accident reports from the
            National Transportation Safety Board detailing what
            happens when an airplane is loaded improperly or
            overloaded. All aircraft are designed to operate
            safely, but only within defined center-of-gravity and
            weight limitations.</p>

            <p>You may have heard the term "weight and balance." In
            this instance, an aircraft's weight includes fuel,
            cargo, passengers, and the unloaded weight of the
            aircraft itself. Balance refers to keeping all of those
            weights within the designed center of gravity.</p>

            <p>The effect of weight and balance on performance is
            critical. Many small aircraft cannot fly safely with
            full fuel and all of the seats filled.</p>

            <p>The effects of added weight on aircraft include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Higher takeoff speed</li>

              <li>Longer takeoff run</li>

              <li>Reduced rate and angle of climb</li>

              <li>Lower maximum altitude</li>

              <li>Shorter range</li>

              <li>Reduced cruising speed</li>

              <li>Reduced maneuverability</li>

              <li>Higher stalling speed</li>

              <li>Higher landing speed</li>

              <li>Longer landing roll.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For helicopters, the effect of added weight also
            affects:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Hovering</li>

              <li>Takeoff</li>

              <li>Climb</li>

              <li>Autorotation</li>

              <li>Landing performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where the loads are placed within the airplane also
            affects flight performance, especially during stalls
            and spins. It's important that you don't load your
            aircraft beyond its design limits, and that you
            distribute the weight in the proper locations. Loads
            distribution affects the center of gravity (CG), which
            in turn affects the stability and control of the
            aircraft.</p><img src=

            <p>There are two ways to fuel your aircraft.</p>

            <p>You can manually add fuel to an airplane by taxiing
            up to a fueling station at airports that have them.
            Fueling stations exist at many airports and look like
            the picture below.</p>

            <p>You can also fuel your airplane using the <strong>Fuel
            and Payload</strong> dialog box. For more information about
            using the dialog box, see <a href=
            "#UnderstandingtheFuelandPayloadDialogBox">
            Understanding the Fuel and Payload dialog box</a>

            "UnderstandingCenterofGravity"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Understanding Center of Gravity</p>

            <p>In technical terms, the center of gravity (CG) of
            any object is the average location of the object's
            weight. An airplane in flight rotates around its
            CG&#8212;the point at which the aircraft would balance
            in all directions if it could be suspended from that
            point&#8212;and if that center is outside of the
            aircraft's designed limits, its controllability may be
            severely compromised.</p>

            <p>Think about how humans walk: We're designed to move
            with our center of gravity within certain limits in
            order to maintain balance. We throw our CG forward
            slightly to move forward, but it remains within a limit
            that keeps us upright. If you try to walk carrying a
            very heavy object, it throws your CG off, making it
            difficult to walk; it may even make you fall over.</p>

            <p>Similarly, if you load an aircraft outside of its CG
            limits, the aircraft still rotates around that point.
            If the CG moves too far forward, the elevator may not
            have enough authority to maintain the correct attitude
            at minimum speeds, as when landing. If the CG moves too
            far aft, a less-stable condition occurs, decreasing the
            ability of the aircraft to right itself after
            maneuvering, stalling, or after disturbances by gusts.
            Remember also that higher weight means higher stall
            speed. Keeping the CG within limits makes for a safer
            and more comfortable flight.</p>

            <p>The CG range for most helicopters is more restricted
            than for airplanes. In some cases this range is less
            than three inches.</p>

            <p>The pilot operating handbook that comes with most
            aircraft has tables that the pilot uses to calculate
            weight and balance. In Flight Simulator it's possible
            to safely experiment flying aircraft that are loaded
            outside the CG limits.</p>

            <p>You can't edit the values on the <strong>Fuel and
            Payload</strong> dialog box; these values are the sums of
            the values on the <strong>Fuel Settings</strong> and <strong>Payload
            Settings</strong> dialog boxes.</p>

            <p><strong>Empty weight:</strong> the weight of the aircraft
            without passengers, fuel, baggage, or cargo.<br>
            <strong>Payload:</strong> the weight of the passengers, baggage,
            and cargo.<br>
            <strong>Fuel:</strong> the weight or volume of fuel on board.<br>
            <strong>Gross weight:</strong> the Gross Weight is the sum of the
            empty weight, fuel weight, and the payload.<br>
            <strong>Max. gross weight:</strong> the aircraft should not be
            loaded beyond this weight or volume.<br>

            <p>In the <strong>Fuel and Payload</strong> dialog box, click the
            <strong>Change Fuel</strong> button to make adjustments in the
            fuel load. You cannot add more fuel than the capacity
            of the tanks. Remember, however, that with some
            aircraft, having a full load of fuel plus passengers in
            every seat may put the aircraft over its maximum
            allowable gross weight.</p>

            <p>For aircraft with multiple fuel tanks, each tank is
            listed in the <strong>Tank</strong> column. The idea is to load
            the tanks in a balanced way to help keep the aircraft
            within CG limits. This can affect performance as well
            as safety: If one wing tank is too heavily loaded, the
            aircraft may fly inefficiently.</p>

            <p>Swept-wing aircraft (like the Boeing aircraft and
            the Bombardier Learjet 45 in Flight Simulator) present
            special challenges. Fuel in outboard tanks has a
            tendency to rotate the aircraft in a tail-heavy
            direction and fuel in inboard tanks adds to a
            nose-heavy condition. The use of fuel from swept-wing
            tanks must be managed carefully to keep the CG within
            designed limits.</p>

            <p>You can adjust fuel quantities by percentage of
            total fuel, by volume, or by weight. The volume
            capacity for each tank is listed in the <strong>Capacity</strong>
            column on the right of the <strong>Fuel Settings</strong> dialog
            box. The current gallons and pounds are totaled at the
            bottom of the table.</p>

            <p>Payload refers to the weight of the passengers,
