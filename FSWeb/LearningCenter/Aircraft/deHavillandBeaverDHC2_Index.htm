            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the DHC&#8211;2 Beaver</p>

            <p>When pilots and flight enthusiasts talk about the de Havilland 
			Beaver, the word that inevitably comes up is "workhorse." 
			For more than 50 years this sturdy radial-engined aircraft 
			has gotten people into and out of remote locations, aided 
			by its power, all-metal ruggedness, and short takeoff and 
			landing (STOL) capability.</p>

            <p>Whether fitted with wheels, skis, or pontoons, the Beaver 
			is a can-do airplane. Often referred to as a "flying half-ton 
			truck," the Beaver is more versatile-and probably tougher-than 
			any light truck. The Beaver's immediate acceptance and 
			long-term success owe a lot to the fact that it was designed 
			from the beginning to meet the needs of Canadian bush pilots.; 
			after World War II, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada polled 
			pilots to learn what their ideal aircraft for rugged duty 
			would be like. The DHC-2 Beaver was the result.</p>

            <p>Almost 2,000 Beavers were manufactured between 1947 and 1967,
			 and refurbished or remanufactured examples remain among the 
			 most sought-after aircraft for pilots and businesses that take 
			 people to remote destinations. No better plane for the purpose 
			 has come along, because the aircraft qualities bush pilots 
			 asked for in the '40s are what they still need today: sturdy 
			 construction, wide stance, the ability to haul heavy loads, 
			 short takeoff and landing capability, excellent reliability, 
			 and simple maintenance.</p>

            <p>The Beaver's design was so successful that almost half of 
			the entire production was purchased by the U.S. armed forces 
			for liaison, light transport, and ambulance duties, under the 
			designation L-20 (later U-6). This unusual purchase by the U.S. 
			government of foreign-built aircraft underlines the superiority 
			of de Havilland's design. Many of these military Beavers 
			survived their service to lead a second, equally active civilian 
			life, some as remanufactured aircraft. These newly-minted 
			versions carry on the Beaver's long tradition as the thoroughbred 
			of workhorse aircraft.</p>
