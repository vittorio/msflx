          <p>There's a lot to be said for the technical wizardry
          and advances that modern airplanes now employ. There are
          now small, single engine aircraft capable of flying
          almost 300 miles an hour. Most pilots now use global
          positioning system (GPS) receivers and electronic
          moving-map displays&#8212;developments that have
          transformed navigation from a complex mental challenge of
          interpreting various needle deflections and positions to
          a simple task of following a miniature airplane's
          progress across a color map. Pilots can even get
          real-time, graphic depictions of weather transmitted from
          ground stations directly into our cockpits. We have
          engine analyzers, terrain displays, onboard computers,
          and reliable autopilots that will even fly our airplanes
          for us on cross-country trips.</p>

          <p>But we pay a price for all of this automated
          technology, a price that's exacted so slowly and
          insidiously that we may not even realize its impact until
          we wake up one day and realize we've lost something we
          once used to value.</p>

          <p>"I don't fly for fun anymore," a pilot once confessed
          to me. "It's gotten boring."</p>

          <p>Flying? Boring? What a thought!</p>

          <p>"Maybe you're going about it the wrong way," I
          suggested. He looked perplexed. I asked how and what he
          usually flew. He answered that he had a high-performance
          twin-engine plane, and usually flew high to take
          advantage of the winds.</p>

          <p>"So you're usually on an instrument flight plan?"</p>

          <p>"Yes," he answered slowly.</p>

          <p>"Do you use an autopilot?"</p>

          <p>"Of course."</p>

          <p>"Ah. Well, that's the problem," I said. &quot;You're not
          flying. You're traveling&#8212;droning along, monitoring
          systems while the airplane flies and you wait to get
          wherever you're going. No wonder you're bored. What you
          need is...&quot; I paused, trying to think about the best cure
          I could suggest for someone whose enjoyment of flight had
          gotten lost somewhere in the efficiency of technology,
          speed and automation.</p>

          <p>"...what you need," I finally concluded, &quot;is a Piper
          Cub.&quot;</p><!--
<div class="pullQuote">"While flying from the back made it a little more difficult to see the instruments, Cubs didn't have very many instruments to look at, anyway."</div>
-->

          <p>The Piper J&#8211;3 Cub is, perhaps, the best-known
          and classic of all light airplanes. Designed as a
          low-cost primary trainer, it was such a success that more
          than 14,000 of them were produced and sold between 1937
          and 1947. In contrast to the big, radial-engine powered
          biplanes that dominated the training market in the 1930s,
          the Cub was a masterpiece of clean, compact simplicity.
          It was small, weighing just more than 1,000 pounds fully
          loaded and fueled. It was inexpensive, selling for about
          a quarter of what other trainers cost. And it was, above
          all else, simple.</p>

          <p>Instead of heavily braced upper and lower wings, the
          Cub employed a single wing built of a light
          wood-and-metal structure covered in cotton fabric. For a
          fuel gauge, the Cub relied on a floating cork attached to
          a thick piece of wire that protruded up through the fuel
          cap on top of the engine cowling. As the fuel emptied,
          the cork simply rode lower in the fuel tank, showing less
          and less wire above the cowling. Instead of complex oleo
          struts, the Cub's landing gear used bungee cords to
          provide shock absorption. The system was simple, but the
          combination of the Cub's big tires, relatively wide gear
          and bungee cord shock absorbers made the Cub one of the
          easiest and softest-landing tailwheel airplanes ever
          built.</p>

          <p>The Cub carried two people, one behind the other, and
          was so light that in order to keep the airplane's weight
          balanced, a pilot flying the plane solo had to sit in the
          back seat to keep his weight closer to the center of the
          airplane. While flying from the back made it a little
          more difficult to see the instruments, Cubs didn't have
          very many instruments to look at anyway.</p>

          <p>The airplane also didn't have an electrical system, so
          Cub pilots had to hand-prop their planes in order to
          start the engine&#8212;a process rather like
          hand-cranking the engine of an old Model T Ford. Someone
          had to stand out front and spin the propeller while the
          pilot turned on the magnetos, held the brakes, and opened
          the throttle in the cockpit. If nobody else was around,
          Cub pilots would have to chock the wheels or tie down the
          tail of the airplane, crack the throttle just a little,
          and swing the prop themselves, scrambling to hop in the
          cockpit after unchocking or untying the airplane before
          it started to move forward.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;...a good portion of an entire generation of pilots
              experienced their first solo flight in this gentle,
              yellow teacher-with-wings.&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>Although the system simplified the design of the
          airplane, there are myriad tales of pilots whose Cubs got
          away from them before they got inside, leading to a
          comical Keystone Cops-like chase of the runaway airplane.
          Sometimes, the Cubs would end up running into hangars or,
          on occasion, even take flight, sans pilot, before
          crash-landing in some near or distant field.</p>

          <p>Part of the Cub's success was due to the Civilian
          Pilot Training (CPT) program, which was initiated by the
          United States government in 1939 as a way of preparing a
          group of pilots to be ready to join the military if the
          United States went to war. The program provided a new
          source of funding for flight training, but it required
          that the training be carried out in an aircraft with a
          tandem configuration. Both the Aeronca and Taylorcraft
          aircraft companies were building small, trainer aircraft
          at the time, but their models featured side-by-side
          seating; the Cub had front-and-back seating. Even though
          Aeronca and Taylorcraft developed tandem models, the Cub
          got the lion's share of the orders.</p>

          <p>The Cub's slow speed, docile handling characteristics,
          and simple systems made it an extremely practical and
          popular trainer, and a good portion of an entire
          generation of pilots experienced their first solo flight
          in this gentle, yellow teacher-with-wings. As time went
          on, however, technology progressed and training aircraft
          improved. More gauges and instruments became available,
          toe brakes and electrical systems became standard
          aircraft features, and easier-landing tricycle-gear
          designs replaced tailwheel configurations. By the
          mid-1950s, the Cessna 150 began to dominate the training
          market, and the Cub should have retreated into the
          obscurity of Model T Fords and horse-drawn carriages.</p>

          <p>But that's not what happened. The Cub was edged out of
          its role as a practical trainer. But like a woman
          released from the practical responsibility of motherhood
          to dance and play as she pleases, the airplane soon
          became a symbol for flying as pure and simple fun. For to
          fly a Cub is to leave all sense of practicality behind;
          to let go of thoughts of timeframes and speed, the
          impatience to "get there" or any notion of sensible
          transport. There are other more modern, well-equipped and
          efficient aircraft to fulfill those roles and carry those
          burdens now. To fly a Cub is to remember instead the
          simple joy of sensation and movement...to discard the
          trappings and noise of the fast-paced, productive world
          to run barefoot on a tropical beach, aware only of the
          feel of the soft sand between your toes, the spray of the
          water, the warmth of the sun, and the caress of the
          gentle ocean breeze against your face.</p>

          <p>I first made this discovery at a small airport in
          southern Ohio, not long after I learned to fly. The
          airport itself was a delightful little haven of things
          old, worn, and cherished, still run by the same brothers
          who'd been building and flying airplanes there since the
          early 1930s. Tucked away inside the old wood and metal
          hangars was an astounding treasure-trove of beautiful
          biplanes and taildraggers that ranged from tiny little
          trainers to sleek cabin and military classics. And among
          those treasures was a beautifully-restored, golden yellow
          J&#8211;3 Cub.</p>

          <p>The first time I saw the Cub, it was sitting in the
          grass in front of the main hangar, its yellow fabric
          fuselage and wings gleaming brightly in the summer
          afternoon sun. I walked around it, admiring its clean,
          simple lines, the tiny black cylinders poking out of its
          form-fitting cowling, the beautifully laminated wooden
          propeller and the cartoon-like shape of its big, soft
          tires. This, I decided, was a friendly plane&#8212;small,
          simple, and somehow docile-looking enough that it seemed
          approachable and easy to fly even without knowing
          anything about it.</p>

          <p>As I peered inside the cockpit, the pilot walked up
          behind me.</p>

          <p>"Pretty simple, isn't it?" he said.</p>

          <p>"It's beautiful!" I answered.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;We stayed low, skimming over treetops and fields
              that were vivid, alive, and seemed almost close
              enough to touch outside the wide open door.&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>The pilot smiled. A pilot's love for an old airplane
          is a difficult thing to explain. The plane may be an
          award-winning showpiece or a tattered old friend. But
          there is something about the simple lines and grace of a
          machine crafted in a far-away time that speaks to
          something deep in the hearts of those who fly them. And
          to those pilots, anyone else who sees and understands
          that same inexplicable beauty is automatically a friend,
          even if they've just said hello.</p>

          <p>"Have you ever flown in one?" the pilot asked.</p>

          <p>I shook my head.</p>

          <p>"Would you like to?"</p>

          <p>He didn't have to ask twice. He showed me how to put
          my foot in the stirrup-step below the door, grab hold of
          the tube structure at the front of the cockpit, and swing
          myself through the door and into the front seat. I held
          the brakes while he hand-propped the plane and hopped
          into the back seat.</p>

          <p>&quot;It's pretty hot out, so if you don't mind, we'll just
          leave the door open,&quot; he said.</p>

          <p>The Cub's door is, in my opinion, one of the
          aircraft's very best features. Instead of a standard door
          and window, the Cub has an unusual, hexagonal-shaped door
          that's split in half horizontally. The top half is a
          window, which can be flipped up flush against the
          underside of the wing and held there with a clip, even in
          flight. The bottom half of the door can also be flipped
          down, flush with the lower part of the fuselage, leaving
          a wide opening on the side of the airplane. Used
          primarily for entering and exiting the plane, this door
          and window combination can also provide a wonderful
          open-air experience in flight without all the riotous
          wind-in-your-face commotion and noise of an open-cockpit
          biplane.</p>

          <p>We rolled and bumped our way down the airport's grass
          runway as we gathered speed, lifting off gently as we
          edged up to 40 miles an hour. I slid open the window on
          my left, allowing even more air to flow past me as we
          banked to the right and headed away from the airport. We
          stayed low, skimming over treetops and fields that were
          vivid, alive, and seemed almost close enough to touch
          outside the wide open door. We crossed over some
          woodlands, then dropped down to follow the winding curves
          of a river, wagging our wings at a couple of kids waving
          to us from a river bluff as we passed. Kids waving at us!
          It's a heartwarming experience every pilot should have,
          and one impossible to find at faster speeds and higher
          altitudes. My grin dissolved into happy, silly laughter
          as we continued to cut and bank our way downstream. I
          leaned back and put my hand out into the slipstream,
          reveling in the sensation of the wind against my arm, the
          faint scent of the earth drifting up from below, and the
          graceful movement of this simple, lightweight dancer in
          the summer afternoon sky.</p>

          <p>As we left the river for the farmland to the west, the
          pilot let me try flying the plane myself. I quickly
          discovered, to my delight, that without all the
          insulation, shock absorption, technology, and automatic
          systems of more modern or complex planes, a Cub lets a
          pilot really feel the sky&#8212;through both the wide
          open doorway and the flight controls themselves. The sky
          speaks in bumps, dips, waves, and nudges, the airplane
          reacts, and the pilot must answer in constant corrections
          of varying volume on controls that are as light as the
          plane. Left hand on the throttle, right hand on the
          stick, feet constantly moving on the rudder pedals, I
          found myself intimately connected with the plane and the
          sky in a living, moving, freeform choreography. And I
          soon became blissfully lost in the joy and sheer fun of
          it all.</p>

          
            <div class="pullQuote">
              &quot;The plane's wonderful impracticality is what makes
              it such a continuing favorite of pilots today.&quot;
            </div>
          

          <p>There are all sorts of things that a Cub doesn't do
          well. It doesn't get anywhere fast, it's tough to fly in
          turbulence or land in a crosswind, and it won't carry
          much in the way of people or baggage. It can get up to
          eight or nine thousand feet, but it doesn't really belong
          there. Its magic is wrought closer to the ground, where
          its simplicity and slow speed allow a pilot to sit back,
          enjoy the flight, and actually see and appreciate the
          scenery as it passes by below.</p>

          <p>The Piper J&#8211;3 Cub may have had very practical
          origins. But the plane's wonderful impracticality is what
          makes it such a continuing favorite of pilots today. In a
          world far too focused on goals, productivity, and
          fast-paced schedules, a Cub is a reminder of the beauty
          we miss by flying through our lives too fast. And for a
          pilot who's forgotten how much fun flying can really be,
          it can be a salve and remedy for the soul. For without
          the clutter of systems and technology, a Cub allows
          pilots to touch and remember the basic sensations and
          emotions that once drew them to the sky. If the Piper Cub
          is still beloved, it's because it reminds pilots again of
          the fun that can be found in going nowhere, the laughter
          that can be found in the feel of the wind flowing over an
          outstretched arm, the magic that can be found in a
          child's wave from a river bluff below, and the simple,
          breathtaking joy of being able to reach out through an
          open doorway and actually touch the sky.</p>
