            <p>Knowledge of a few general principles of engine
            operation helps pilots operate engines efficiently,
            extends the operating life of the power plant, and
            helps avoid engine failures.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Basic Piston Engine Principles</p>

            <p>Reciprocating piston engines are the most common
            power plants on general aviation aircraft. These
            engines are virtually identical to automobile engines,
            with three important exceptions:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Most aircraft engines are air cooled. This
              approach saves the weight of a radiator and coolant
              and adds a measure of safety. The loss of coolant or
              a failure of the cooling system in a liquid-cooled
              engine quickly causes complete engine failure.</li>

              <li>Aircraft engines have dual ignition systems, with
              the energy to create the spark generated by magnetos.
              A magneto, turned by the crankshaft, isn't dependent
              on the aircraft battery. Each cylinder also has two
              spark plugs. If one plug or magneto fails, the other
              provides a spark to burn fuel.</li>

              <li>Because an aircraft engine operates throughout a
              wide range of altitudes, the power controls include a
              manual mixture control that the pilot uses to
              maintain the proper air/fuel ratio as the airplane
              climbs and descends.</li>
            </ol><a name="TheFourStrokeCycle"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Four-Stroke Cycle</p>

            <p>A typical piston engine operates according to a
            four-stroke cycle.</p>

            <p><strong>Intake:</strong> The piston moves down in the
            cylinder, drawing in air and fuel through the open
            intake valve.</p>

            <p><strong>Compression:</strong> The intake and exhaust valves in
            the cylinder close and the piston moves up in the
            cylinder, compressing the fuel-air mixture.</p>

            <p><strong>Power:</strong> As the piston nears the top of the
            cylinder during the compression stroke, a burst of
            electricity from the ignition system generates a spark
            in the spark plugs. The sparks ignite the air/fuel
            mixture, which expands rapidly as it burns. The force
            of this expansion drives the piston back down in the
            cylinder. As the piston moves down, it turns the
            crankshaft, which turns the propeller.</p>

            <p><strong>Exhaust:</strong> When the piston reaches the bottom
            of the cylinder, the exhaust valve opens. The piston
            then moves back up in the cylinder, pushing the burned
            air/fuel mixture out of the cylinder.</p>

            <p>Each cylinder cycles through these four strokes in
            turn, ensuring that at least one piston is always
            producing power.</p><a name=
            "CarburetorsandFuelInjectors"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Carburetors and Fuel Injectors</p>

            <p>Most piston engines used in aircraft have either a
            carburetor or fuel injection system to deliver fuel and
            air to the cylinders. The carburetor mixes fuel and air
            before it enters the cylinders. Carburetors are common
            on smaller engines because they're relatively
            inexpensive. Larger engines usually have fuel-injection
            systems, which squirt fuel directly into the cylinders,
            where it mixes with air during the intake
            stroke.</p><a name="IgnitionSystems"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ignition Systems</p>

            <p>The ignition system provides a spark to ignite the
            air/fuel mixture in the cylinders of a piston engine.
            Most modern aircraft engines use magnetos to generate
            the spark. Although not as sophisticated as the
            electronic ignition systems used in the latest cars,
            magnetos are useful in aircraft because:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>They produce a hotter spark at high engine speeds
              than the battery system used in automobiles.</li>

              <li>They do not depend on an external source of
              energy such as a battery, a generator, or an
              alternator.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
            Magnetos generate electricity when they rotate. So, to
            start the engine, the pilot must engage a
            battery-powered starter that rotates the crankshaft.
            After the magnetos begin rotating, they supply the
            spark to each cylinder to ignite the air/fuel mixture
            and the starter system is disengaged. The battery no
            longer has any part in the operation of the engine. If
            the battery (or master) switch is turned off, the
            engine continues to run.</p>

            <p><strong>Dual Ignition</strong><br>
            <img src="images/PistonEngines02.jpg" width="79"
            height="83" alt="" border="0"><br>
            Most aircraft engines are equipped with a dual ignition
            system&#8212;two magnetos that supply electrical
            current to two spark plugs for each cylinder. One
            magneto system supplies the current to one set of
            plugs; the second system supplies the current to the
            other set of plugs. This is why the ignition switch on
            the Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172 (marked as
            <strong>MAGNETO</strong> on some planes) has five positions:
            <strong>OFF</strong>, <strong>L</strong> (<strong>left</strong>), <strong>R</strong>
            (<strong>right</strong>), <strong>BOTH</strong>, and <strong>START</strong>. With the
            switch in the <strong>L</strong> or <strong>R</strong> position, only one
            magneto supplies current and only one set of spark
            plugs fires. With the switch in the <strong>BOTH</strong>
            position, both magnetos supply current and both sets of
            spark plugs fire.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages of Dual Ignition</strong><br>
            Aircraft have dual ignition systems for safety and
            efficiency.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>If one magneto system fails, the engine can
              operate on the other system until you can make a safe
              landing.</li>

              <li>Two spark plugs improve burning and combustion of
              the mixture, delivering improved performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Operating the Ignition System</strong><br>
            You should turn the ignition switch to <strong>BOTH</strong>
            after starting the engine and leave it on <strong>BOTH</strong>
            during flight. Turn it <strong>OFF</strong> after shutting down
            the engine. If you leave the ignition switch on
            <strong>BOTH</strong> (or <strong>L</strong> or <strong>R</strong>), the engine could
            fire if the propeller is moved from outside the
            airplane&#8212;even if the electrical master switch is
            off.</p>

            <p><strong>Before Takeoff Check</strong><br>
            To make sure both ignition systems are operating
            properly, check each system during the engine run-up
            before takeoff. The normal procedure is to set the
            power at about 1700 rpm. Turn the ignition switch from
            <strong>BOTH</strong> to <strong>R</strong>, then back to <strong>BOTH</strong>, then
            to <strong>L</strong>, and then back to <strong>BOTH</strong>. You should
            see a slight drop in rpm each time you switch from
            <strong>BOTH</strong> to either <strong>R</strong> or <strong>L</strong>. If both
            magnetos are functioning normally, the drop should be
            no more than about 75 rpm.</p>

            <p><strong>Shutting Down the Engine</strong><br>
            You should not shut down a piston engine by turning the
            ignition switch to <strong>OFF</strong>. Instead, move the
            mixture control to the idle cutoff position to turn off
            the fuel supply to the cylinders. After the engine
            stops, turn the ignition switch to <strong>OFF</strong>. This
            procedure ensures that no fuel remains in the cylinders
            and that the engine won't start accidentally if someone
            turns the prop or if carbon deposits inside the
            cylinders create hot spots that ignite residual
            fuel.</p><a name="PistonEngineControls"></a>

            <p>Most modern piston engines have two or three basic
            controls.</p>

              <li><strong>Propeller control</strong> (if the aircraft is
              equipped with a constant-speed propeller) to adjust

            <p>Carbureted engines also have carburetor heat to
            prevent the formation of or to melt carburetor ice.
            Engines of about 200 horsepower or more usually have
            cowl flaps to allow the pilot to adjust the amount of
            cooling air that flows over the engine. Opening the
            cowl flaps is especially important during high-power
            operations such as takeoff and prolonged
            climbs.</p><a name="Propellers"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Propellers</p>

            <p>Piston engines are typically connected to a
            fixed-pitch or a constant-speed propeller.</p>

            <p><strong>Fixed-pitch propellers</strong> are bolted directly to
            the crankshaft of the engine and therefore always turn
            at the same speed as the engine. A fixed-pitch prop is
            somewhat like a transmission with only one gear. This
            configuration makes up for its lack of efficiency by
            being very simple to operate. The only gauge that you
            need to monitor is the tachometer.</p>

            <p><strong>A constant-speed propeller</strong> has a governor
            that adjusts the angle of the blades to maintain the
            rpm you select. This type of propeller makes much more
            efficient use of the engine's power. At low speed when
            maximum power is required (as during takeoff), you
            select maximum rpm or "full increase" with the
            propeller control, and the propeller blades meet the
            air at a small angle. During cruise, you adjust the rpm
            to a lower setting, and the blades take a bigger bite
            of the air while turning a lower speed.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Managing the Power</p>

            <p>With a fixed-pitch propeller, managing power is
            simple. Push the throttle in, and rpm (and power)
            increases. Pull the throttle out, and rpm decreases. Be
            aware, however, that as airspeed increases, rpm tends
            to creep up, too. Monitor the tachometer carefully
            during descents at high speed to make sure that the rpm
            stays within limits.</p>

            <p>A constant-speed propeller makes power management a
            bit more complicated. You must monitor the manifold
            pressure gauge, controlled by the throttle, and the
            tachometer, which shows the propeller rpm. You adjust
            rpm with the prop control.</p>

            <p>When setting power with a constant-speed propeller,
            remember these basic rules to avoid overstressing the
            engine:</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Engines with Carburetors</p>

            <p>Many aircraft piston engines use carburetors to
            combine air and fuel to create a combustible mixture
            that burns in the cylinders.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How a Carburetor Works</p>

            <p>Outside air flows through an air filter, then into
            the carburetor. The air flows through a venturi, a
            narrow throat in the carburetor. The air accelerates in
            the venturi and its pressure drops according to
            Bernoulli's principle. The partial vacuum forces fuel
            to flow through a jet into the airstream where it mixes
            with the flowing air. The air/fuel mixture then flows
            into the intake manifold, which routes it to each
            cylinder.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Right Ratio</p>

            <p>The carburetor mixes air and fuel by weight. Piston
            engines generally produce maximum power when the
            air/fuel mixture is about 15:1.Carburetors are
            calibrated at sea-level pressure to meter the correct
            amount of fuel with the mixture control in the full
            rich position. As altitude increases, air density
            decreases. To compensate for this difference, the pilot
            uses the mixture control to adjust the air/fuel mixture
            entering the combustion chamber.</p>

            <p>To control the amount of fuel that mixes with the
            air, most carburetors use a float in a fuel chamber. A
            needle attached to the float opens and closes an
            opening in the fuel line, metering the correct amount
            of fuel into the carburetor. The position of the float,
            controlled by the fuel level in the float chamber,
            determines when the valve opens and closes.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Running Rich</p>

            <p>An air/fuel mixture that is too rich&#8212;that is,
            it contains too much fuel&#8212;causes excessive fuel
            consumption, rough engine operation, and loss of power.
            Running an engine too rich also cools the engine,
            causing below-normal temperatures in the combustion
            chambers, which leads to spark plug fouling, among
            other problems.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Running Lean</p>

            <p>Operating with the mixture too lean&#8212;too little
            fuel for the current weight of air&#8212;results in
            rough engine operation, detonation, overheating, and a
            loss of power.</p><a name="CarburetorIce"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Carburetor Ice</p>

            <p>Vaporization of fuel and expansion of the air in the
            carburetor causes sudden cooling of the air/fuel
            mixture. The temperature may drop as much as 60 F (15
            C) within a fraction of a second. This cooling causes
            water vapor in the air to condense, and if the
            temperature in the carburetor reaches 32 degrees F (0
            C) the water freezes inside the carburetor passages.
            Even a slight accumulation of this deposit can restrict
            the flow of air into the carburetor, reducing power.
            Carburetor ice may also lead to complete engine
            failure, particularly when the throttle is partly or
            fully closed.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Icing Conditions</p>

            <p>On dry days, or when the temperature is well below
            freezing, the moisture in the air generally doesn't
            cause carburetor ice. But if the temperature is between
            20 F (-7 C) and 70 F (21 C), with visible moisture or
            high humidity, the pilot should be constantly on the
            alert for carburetor ice.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Indications of Carburetor Icing</p>

            <p>For airplanes with fixed-pitch propellers, the first
            indication of carburetor icing is a drop in rpm on the
            tachometer. For airplanes with controllable pitch
            (constant-speed) propellers, the first indication is
            usually a drop in manifold pressure. In both cases, the
            engine may start to run rough. In airplanes with
            constant-speed propellers, rpm remains constant.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Thawing Out</p>

            <p>To prevent carburetor ice from forming and to
            eliminate ice that forms, carburetors are equipped with
            heaters. The carburetor heater preheats the air before
            it reaches the carburetor. This preheating melts ice or
            snow entering the intake, melts ice that forms in the
            carburetor passages (provided the accumulation is not
            too great), and keeps the air/fuel mixture above
            freezing to prevent formation of carburetor ice.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Using Carburetor Heat</p>

            <p>When flying in conditions conducive to carburetor
            icing, monitor the engine instruments to watch for
            signs that ice is forming. If you suspect that
            carburetor ice is present, apply full carburetor heat
            immediately. Leave it on full until you're certain that
            all the ice has been removed. Applying partial heat or
            leaving heat on for too short a time may aggravate the
            situation.</p>

            <p>When you first apply carburetor heat, expect a drop
            in rpm in airplanes equipped with fixed-pitch
            propellers; in airplanes equipped with constant-speed
            propellers, expect a drop in manifold pressure. If no
            carburetor ice is present, rpm or manifold pressure
            will remain lower than normal until the carburetor heat
            is turned off. If carburetor ice is present, expect a
            rise in rpm or manifold pressure after the initial drop
            (often accompanied by intermittent engine roughness).
            When you turn carburetor heat off, the rpm or manifold
            pressure rises above the value before heat was applied.
            The engine should also run more smoothly after the ice
            has melted.</p>

            <p>In extreme cases of carburetor icing, after the ice
            has been removed you may need to apply just enough
            carburetor heat to prevent further ice formation.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Carburetor Heat as a Precaution</p>

            <p>Whenever the throttle is closed during flight,
            especially as you prepare to land, the engine cools
            rapidly and vaporization of the fuel is less complete
            than if the engine is warm. If you suspect carburetor
            icing conditions, apply full carburetor heat before
            closing the throttle and leave the heat on.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">More Power</p>

            <p>Use of carburetor heat tends to reduce the output of
            the engine and increase the engine's operating
            temperature. Therefore, don't use carburetor heat when
            you need full power (as during takeoff) or during
            normal engine operation except to check for the
            presence or removal of carburetor ice.</p><a name=
            "FuelInjectedEngines"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Fuel-Injected Engines</p>

            <p>Piston engines rated at more than 200 horsepower
            often use a fuel-injection system rather than a
            carburetor.</p>

            <p>A fuel-injection system squirts fuel directly into
            the cylinders or just ahead of the intake valve. The
            fuel then mixes with air in the cylinders. Because this
            type of system requires high-pressure pumps, an
            air/fuel control unit, a fuel distributor, and
            discharge nozzles for each cylinder, it's generally
            more expensive than a carburetor.</p>

            <p>As with an engine equipped with a carburetor, the
            pilot controls the flow of fuel by adjusting the
            mixture control.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Advantages of Fuel Injection</p>

            <p>Fuel injection has several advantages over a
            carbureted fuel system, which compensate for its
            greater cost and complexity.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>No possibility of carburetor ice (although impact
              ice can block air intakes).</li>

              <li>Better fuel flow.</li>

              <li>Faster throttle response.</li>

              <li>Precise control of mixture.</li>

              <li>Better fuel distribution.</li>

              <li>Easier cold-weather starts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead2">Disadvantages of Fuel Injection</p>

            <p>Fuel injection does have some disadvantages, the
            most important being:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Difficulty in starting a hot engine.</li>

              <li>Vapor locks during ground operations on hot
              days.</li>

              <li>Difficulty restarting an engine that quits as the
              result of fuel starvation.</li>
