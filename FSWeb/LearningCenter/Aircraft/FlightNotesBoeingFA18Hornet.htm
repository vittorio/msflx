            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 35,000 pounds (15,875 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176;C<br> Lower weights and temperatures
            result in better performance, as does having a
            headwind component. Higher altitudes and temperatures

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. Use the checklist on the
			Kneeboard for step-by-step procedures.</p><a name=

            <p>Idle thrust is
            adequate for taxiing under most conditions. 
			Allow time for a response after each
            thrust change before changing the thrust setting
            again.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, rudder pedals (twist the
            joystick, use the rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong>
            [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the numeric keypad)
            are used for directional control during taxiing.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p>All of the following occurs quite rapidly. Read
            through the procedure several times before attempting
            it in the plane so you know what to expect.</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist.</p>

            <p>With the aircraft aligned with the runway
            centerline, advance the throttles (press <strong>F3</strong>, or
            drag the throttle levers) to MIL power (or afterburner if desired). 
			The exact amount of initial setting is
            not as important as setting symmetrical thrust.</p>

            <p>Directional control is maintained by use of the rudder
            pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder pedals, or
            press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the
            numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>Because of the position of the main landing gear, you 
			cannot rotate early in the takeoff roll. Hold the stick just 
			aft of neutral during the initial run. Hold the stick aft until the
			nose is 6&deg; to 8&deg; high attitude. The main gear will lift-off 
			around 173 knots, requiring slight forward stick to maintain the 
			desired attitude.</p>

            <p>For a minimal takeoff run, use full afterburner. Apply full aft 
			stick until the aircraft begins to rotate.</p>

            <p>Once a positive rate of climb is established, retract the 
			landing gear. Accelerate to the desired climb 
			speed.</p><a name="takeoffcarrier"></a>

			Mission. Run through the Before Takeoff checklist.</p>

            <p>The F/A-18 requires an assisted takeoff from an aircraft 
			carrier deck. A steam catapult meets this
			requirement by attaching to the nose landing gear and essentially
			dragging the multi-ton aircraft to takeoff speed from zero to

			lower the leading edge and trailing edge flaps and operate the ailerons 
			 in the drooped position.</p>
			
			<p>The outstanding high-AOA characteristics come at a price: operating 
			in this regime results in intense energy bleed. The Hornet is 
			an aircraft that gets slow faster than most when turning hard, 
			and it's also a little slower to regain lost energy. A 5 degree nose 
			high attitude allows acceleration to 350 knots.</p>
			
			<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Be aware that fuel capacity is low and fuel consumption
			is high in the Hornet.</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>As you retract the flaps, set climb power of
            approximately 42 percent N1 (press <strong>F2</strong>, use the
            throttle control on your joystick, or drag the thrust
            levers). Maintain 5 degrees nose-up pitch
            attitude to climb at 350 knots until reaching 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters), and then as desired to your
            cruising altitude.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally determined by winds,
            weather, and other factors. You might want to use these
            factors in your flight planning if you have created
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude
            gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>Chances are you will not be flying the Hornet at slow
			speeds for best fuel economy. You also do not need to worry
			about passenger comfort.</p>

            <p>Typical cruise speed is 580 knots at high altitude
			(720 knots at low altitude). The Hornet is capable of reaching
			Mach 1.8 (1,127 mph, 1,814 km/h) at 36,100 ft (11,000 m). The changeover from
            indicated airspeed to Mach number typically occurs as
            you climb to altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000
            to 9,000 meters).</p>
			
			<p>Maximum-range cruise airspeed is approximated by flying at
			 4.2&deg; AOA, no faster than 0.85 Mach. Maximum endurance can be
			  approximated by flying 5.6&deg; AOA.</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher in the thin, cold air. You'll have to experiment
            with power settings to find the setting that maintains
            the cruise speed you want at the altitude you
            choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile requires knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            35,000 feet (10,668 meters) to sea level:<br>
            35,000 minus the last three zeros is 35.<br>
            35 x 3=105</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 105
            nautical miles from your destination, maintaining a
            speed of 300 KIAS and a descent
            rate of 1,500 to 2,000 feet per minute, with thrust set
            at idle. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>To descend, disengage the autopilot if you turned it
            on during cruise, or set the airspeed or vertical speed
            into the autopilot and let it do the flying for you.
            Reduce power to idle, and lower the nose slightly. Continue this profile down to the
            beginning of the approach phase of flight.</p>

            <p>Deviations from this procedure can result in
            arriving too high at the destination (requiring
            circling to descend) or arriving too low and far out
            (requiring expenditure of extra time and fuel). Plan to
            have an initial approach fix regardless of whether or
            not you're flying an instrument approach.</p><a name="ApproachRunway"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Tactical Approach (runway)</p>
			  
			 <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To practice making 
			 tactical&#8212;or corkscrew&#8212;approaches in the F/A-18, fly the 
			 <strong>Corkscrew Approach</strong> Mission. Click <strong>Missions</strong> 
			 on the left-hand menu and then select the 
			 <strong>Military</strong> category.</p>
			  
			  <p>Enter the pattern per local rules but on the opposite side
			  of the runway from downwind. At the break to crosswind, 
			  reduce thrust and extend the speed brake (if required). 
			  As the airspeed decreases through	250 knots, lower the landing 
			  gear and extend the flaps to FULL. Retract the speed brake.</p> 
			
			<p>Decelerate to final speed. Complete the landing checklist. 
			Roll into the base leg and establish a rate of descent, maintaining AOA. </p>
			
			Speed on final with 2,000 pounds of internal fuel 
			is about 134 knots. Add about 2.5 knots for each 1,000 pounds additional
			 fuel. Avoid overcontrolling the throttles.</p><a name="LandingRunway"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing (runway)</p>

            <p>At touchdown, reduce the throttles to idle. The Hornet tends to 
			align itself with the runway centerline. Use the rudder pedals to make
			small corrections in alignment.</p>
			
			<p>Once the nosewheel is on the ground, hold the stick full aft and
			brake lightly.</p><a name="ApproachCarrier"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach (aircraft carrier)</p>
			  
			<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To practice making carrier approaches 
			and landings in the F/A-18, fly the following Missions:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Carrier Tutorial</strong>
				<li><strong>Carrier Practice</strong>
				<li><strong>Carrier Landing IMC</strong>
			</ul>
			 Click <strong>Missions</strong> on the left-hand menu and 
			 then select the <strong>Military</strong> or <strong>Tutorial</strong>
			  category.</p>
			 
			 <p>The daytime traffic pattern for carrier landings is "race track"
			shape with the downwind leg at 600 feet, 180 degrees opposite 
			the Base Recovery Course (the heading the ship is on). Enter the 
			traffic pattern by flying at an altitude of 800 feet straight up
			 the ship's wake, passing the ship close on the right side. Fly this
			  at about 250 knots. If this is a full stop landing, lower the 
			  tailhook.</p>
			  
			  <p>After passing the ship, perform a full-aileron-deflection left snap 
			  roll to a 70 to 90 degree angle of bank, reduce the throttle to idle, 
			  and extend full speed-brakes.</p>
			  
			  As you bank over, pull the stick back to about a 3 to 4 'g' pull and 
			  maintain this high-g turn level. Deceleration to flap extension and 
			  landing airspeed is swift. Be very careful to roll out of this turn 
			  on the exact reciprocal, downwind heading.
			  
			  <p>As you slow down and turn on heading for the downwind leg, descend out 
			of 800 feet for 600 feet. Extend the landing gear and lower flaps to full.
			Increase the throttle to manage your descent. Trim the aircraft to reduce
			control pressures. Once established on the downwind leg, complete your 
			landing checklist.</p>
			
			<p>Final airspeed varies widely due to remaining fuel load. Instead of using the
			 airspeed indicator, refer to the angle-of-attack, or AOA indicator. There 
			 is an optimal AOA that results in the optimal approach airspeed, no matter 
			 what your aircraft's gross weight. The AOA indicator has a small array of 
			 colored lights atop the instrument panel. </p>

		<p>If the yellow center 'o' is lit, you're 'on speed' or at the correct AOA. If 
		the green upper chevron is lit, your airspeed is too slow&#8212;pitch the 
		airplane nose-down a little to speed up. If the red lower chevron is lit, your
		airspeed is too fast&#8212;pitch the airplane's nose-up to manage speed. 
		Control airspeed with pitch attitude and control rate of descent with 
		the throttle.</p> 

			<p>Correct position at this point is off the ship's port side at about 1 
			to 1.25 miles. Begin your turn to final approach when abeam the stern of 
			the ship. You should be on speed and trimmed up for hands-off flight. </p>
			
			<p>Reduce the throttle while maintaining your AOA by small pitch angle changes 
			so that the aircraft maintains a 250-foot-per-minute rate of descent. 
			Maintain this regime until 90 degrees of turn from downwind. You should 
			be descending through 450 feet, still on speed. Your rate of descent can 
			now increase to 400-450 feet per minute.</p>


			<p>At 45 degrees from the final heading you should see the "meatball," the 
			optical carrier landing aid. This is a light array about 6 feet high just 
			to the left of the landing area on the flight deck. It has a horizontal row 
			of green lights, called the datum lights, and an orange light (the meatball)
			 that rides up and down to indicate your position relative to the optimum 
			 glideslope.</p>
			 
			 <p>As you reach your final approach heading, roll out of your bank. You should 
			 be established on the extended center line that runs down the 
			 landing area on the flight deck (remember that modern carrier
			 landing areas are at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the ship).</p>
			 
			 <p>On final approach (15 to 20 seconds from landing) an ideal carrier 
			 landing follows a 3-degree glide slope all the way to touch down. You
			  see a centered meatball with no deviations, and airspeed is pegged 
			  at the optimum AOA. To maintain this you must make constant, rapid, small
			   corrections. </p>
			   
			   <p><strong>DO NOT look at the landing area</strong>. Constantly shift 
			   your attention between the meatball, your line-up, and your 
			   AOA indicator.</p><a name="LandingCarrier"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing (carrier)</p>

            <p>Fly the glide-slope until you contact the carrier deck. Impact is 
			dramatic and, since your attention is on the meatball not the landing 
			area, you should be surprised by contact with the deck.</p>
			
			<p>The ship has four arrestor wires and, if you do it right, the point 
			of your tailhook will hit in the middle of them (resulting in the term 
			for an ideal landing&#8212;"3-wire").</p>
			
			<p>Here's another surprise of carrier landings: at the moment of touchdown, 
			<strong>smoothly and quickly advance the throttles to FULL</strong>!</p>
			
			<p>It is possible for the hook to miss the arrestor wires. Even with a
			perfect approach, the hook can bounce over the wires (this is called a bolter).
			Jet engines take a few seconds to spool-up to full power, so you need to be
			at full power during a bolter in order to fly off the landing area.</p>
			
			Even at full throttle, the arrestor wires still stop the Hornet. In fact,
			you decelerate from 135 knots to a dead stop in about a second.<p>
			 
			 <p>Once you've arrested, chop the power, raise the tailhook and taxi to 
			 a parking spot.</p>
