            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Takeoff: 2,000 feet (610 meters), flaps 10<br>
            Landing: 2,500 feet (762 meters), flaps full</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 3,200 pounds (975 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176; C<br>
            Runway: hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine is running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engine down, you can initiate
            an auto-startup sequence by pressing <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If
            you want to do the startup procedures manually, use the
            checklist on the Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>While taxiing, the power should be set at around
            1000 rpm (prop and mixture are full forward.) As you
            move down the taxiway, turn the nose right and left for
            directional control by using the rudder (twist the
            joystick, use the rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> 
			[left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right]
            on the numeric keypad).</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist, and set
            flaps to 10 degrees (press <strong>F7</strong>, or click the
            flaps lever on the panel).</p>

            <p>Cowl flaps should be OPEN for takeoff and climb
            (click the <strong>Cowl Flaps</strong> switch).</p>

            <p>With the aircraft aligned with the runway
            centerline, advance the throttle control to full power
            and monitor the manifold pressure during the initial
            stage of the takeoff roll (it should remain at or below
            38 inches of mercury). Fuel pressure should read a
            minimum of 24 PSI.</p>

            <p>At around 60 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS),
            smoothly pull the stick back (using the joystick or
            yoke, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to raise the nose
            to 10 degrees above the horizon. Climb out at 85
            KIAS.</p>

            <p>As soon as you have a positive rate of climb on
            liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude are
            increasing), retract the landing gear (press <strong>G</strong>
            on the keyboard, or click the landing gear lever on the
            panel). Then, raise the flaps (press <strong>F6</strong>, or drag
            the flaps lever). Accelerate to 105 KIAS.</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>For the climb to cruise altitude, the recommended
            parameters are 2400 rpm (press <strong>CTRL+F2</strong>, or drag
            the prop control) and 34 inches manifold pressure
            (press <strong>F2</strong>, or drag the throttle control). The
            cowl flaps should remain open. Your climb speed should
            be around 120 KIAS.</p>

            <p>For best fuel efficiency, adjust the mixture (press
            <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+F2</strong>, or drag the mixture control)
            until the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) gauge reads
            peak value for the chosen power setting. Changes in
            altitude or power may require adjustments of TIT.
            Operation at a TIT in excess of 1,750 F (954 C) is
            prohibited.</p>

            <p>If fluctuations appear on the fuel pressure gauge
            during prolonged climbs or when you reduce power upon
            reaching cruise altitude, turn the fuel boost pump on
            (click the Fuel Boost switch) until the fluctuations
            cease.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>Best power settings will result in both high cruise
            speeds and high fuel flow.</p>

            <p>Set the propeller rpm at 2400 and the manifold
            pressure at 34 inches. Set the mixture at peak TIT.
            Lower power settings will result in better fuel flow
            and range.</p>

            <p>For best fuel efficiency, adjust the mixture (press
            <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+F2</strong>, or drag the mixture control)
            until TIT reads peak value for the chosen power
            setting. Changes in altitude or power may require
            adjustments of TIT. Operation at a TIT in excess of
            1,750 F is prohibited.</p>

            <p>At altitudes above 22,000 ft (6,706 m) and at
            manifold pressures above 32 inches, only best power
            (1,650 degrees TIT) or richer mixture is permitted.</p>

            <p>Cowl flaps should be CLOSED for cruise and descent
            (click the Cowl Flaps lever).</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>Avoid extended descents at manifold pressure
            settings below 15 inches, as the engine may cool
            excessively.</p>

            <p>Using a descent from 18,000 feet (5,486 meters) as
            an example, set the propeller at 2000 rpm and the
            manifold pressure as required to maintain a rate of
            descent of 500 to 750 feet per minute (fpm). A typical
            descent is done at around 150 KIAS. Keep the engine
            leaned to peak TIT during your descent.</p>

            <p>In the example above, the descent would take
            approximately 24 minutes to reach sea level and cover
            nearly 69 miles (111 kilometers). If necessary, you can
            leave the power up and deploy the speed brakes to
            increase your rate of descent.</p><a name=
            "Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>Below 110 KIAS, you can begin extending the flaps.
            The flaps are good at reducing airspeed. Extending the landing gear can also reduce
            speed (140 KIAS or below).</p>

            <p>Plan to slow to around 110 KIAS entering the
            downwind or at your initial approach fix on an
            instrument approach.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Final approach with full flaps deployed should be
            flown at around 75 KIAS. The propeller and mixture
            controls should be full forward. On final approach,
            verify that the landing gear is down.</p>

            <p>Select a point past the runway threshold and aim for
            it. Adjust your pitch so that the point remains
            stationary in your view out the windscreen. Leave the
            power at your final approach setting, and fly the
            airplane down to the runway. Reduce power to idle just
            before flaring and touch down.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, bring the power back to idle, apply
            the brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key), and exit the
            runway. Retract the wing flaps (press <strong>F6</strong>).</p>
