            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Takeoff: 4,193 feet, flaps up<br>
            Landing: 3,300 feet, approach flaps extended</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 15,000 pounds (6,804 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176;C<br>
            Runway: hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <p>The propellers on the King Air 350 will
            automatically feather on engine shutdown and unfeather
            when the engines are started.</p>

            <p>The power levers on the King Air control engine
            power, from idle to takeoff power, by controlling N1.
            Increasing N1 increases engine power. The power levers
            have three regions: <strong>Forward Thrust</strong>, <strong>Ground
            Fine</strong>, and <strong>Reverse</strong>. When moved into the
            Reverse region, the levers control both engine power
            and propeller blade angle.</p>

            <p>The propeller levers are operated forward and aft
            for setting the required rpm for various phases of
            flight. The normal range is from 1450 to 1700 rpm. To
            feather a propeller manually, move the prop lever
            (press <strong>CTRL+F2</strong>, or drag the prop levers) back
            into the red-and-white striped section of the quadrant
            (autofeather is on by default and will take care of
            feathering in the event of an engine failure).</p>

            <p>The condition levers have three positions: <strong>Fuel
            Cutoff</strong>, <strong>Low Idle</strong>, and <strong>Hi Idle</strong>. At Low
            Idle, the N1 range is from a minimum of 62 percent to a
            maximum of 104 percent. At Hi Idle, the range is from
            70 percent to 104 percent. Low Idle is the condition
            setting for 99 percent of the King Air's operating
            range.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>The normal power setting for taxiing is the Ground
            Fine setting (press <strong>F2</strong> on the keyboard, or drag
            the power levers). For normal operation on the ground
            when the props are not in feather, the rpm should be
            maintained above 1050. The prop levers should be set to
            maintain rpm above 1050 or below 400 while on the
            ground to avoid propeller resonance. Sustained
            operation in feather at engine idle should be avoided.
            Monitor interstage turbine temperature (ITT) to avoid
            exceeding ground-operations temperature limits of 750
            C.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>Unless the runway is short, a no-flaps takeoff is
            standard for the King Air. On the King Air 350,
            available flap settings are <strong>Up</strong>, <strong>Approach</strong>,
            or <strong>Down</strong>. The flaps cannot be stopped at an
            intermediate point between these positions. See the
            Kneeboard for the flap operating speeds.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist. With the
            aircraft aligned with the runway centerline, check that
            the propeller levers are full forward and that the
            condition levers are in Low Idle (press
            <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+F2</strong>, or drag the levers).</p>

            <p>Advance the power levers to 100 percent N1, and
            monitor the ITT during the takeoff roll (it should
            remain at or below 750 C).</p>

            <p>Directional control is maintained by use of the
            rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder
            pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            [right] on the numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>V1, approximately 105 knots indicated airspeed
            (KIAS), is decision speed. Above this speed, it may not
            be possible to stop the aircraft on the runway in case
            of a rejected takeoff (RTO).</p>

            <p>At Vr, approximately 110 KIAS, smoothly pull the
            stick back (use the joystick or yoke, or press the DOWN
            ARROW) to raise the nose to 10 degrees above the
            horizon.</p>

            <p>At V2, approximately 117 KIAS, the aircraft has
            reached its takeoff safety speed. This is the minimum
            safe flying speed should an engine fail. Hold this
            speed until you get a positive rate of climb.</p>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude
            are increasing), retract the landing gear (press
            <strong>G</strong>, or drag the landing gear lever).</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Set climb power to approximately 90 percent N1
            (press <strong>F2</strong>, use the throttle control on your
            joystick, or drag the thrust levers). Set the prop rpm
            to 1600. Turn the synchrophaser on (click the <strong>Prop
            Synch</strong> button). Maintain 6- or 7-degrees nose-up
            pitch attitude to climb to your cruising altitude. Your
            indicated airspeed will vary in a climb as you hold a
            constant power setting and pitch attitude. Expect it to
            read approximately:</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for FL 300.
            Approaching your cruising altitude, begin leveling off
            at about 50 feet (15 meters) below your target
            altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the King Air
            in cruise if you use the autopilot. The autopilot can
            hold your specified altitude, speed, heading, VOR
            course, and more. For more information on using the
            autopilot, see <a href="../InTheCockpit/UsingAnAutopilot.htm">Using an Autopilot</a>.</p>

            <p>A typical power setting in the King Air for the
            parameters chosen here is 66 percent on the torque
            (percent) gauge. That will give you a fuel flow of
            around 575 pounds per hour (PPH) and an indicated
            airspeed of 185 knots. The propeller levers should be
            set to maintain 1500 rpm.</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher in the thin, cold air. Experiment with power
            settings to find the one that maintains the cruise
            speed and fuel consumption you want at the altitude you
            choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing when to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done using idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            30,000 feet (9,144 meters) to sea level:<br>
            30,000 minus the last three zeros is 30.<br>
            30 x 3=90.</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 90 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 250
            KIAS (it won't indicate this high until you descend
            into denser air), and a descent rate of 1,500 feet per
            minute. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind, if applicable.</p>

            <p>In the King Air, adjust thrust during descent to
            maintain 250 KIAS or VMO, whichever is less (use the
            joystick throttle, or press <strong>F2</strong> to decrease
            thrust and <strong>F3</strong> to increase thrust). The propeller
            levers should remain at 1500 rpm.</p>

            <p>The King Air performance manual says that this
            descent profile will take 20 minutes, 103 miles, and
            245 pounds of fuel.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>As you near the approach phase of flight, begin to
            bring the power back to around 55 percent torque or
            less, so that you're below 180 KIAS by your initial
            approach fix (use the joystick throttle, or press
            <strong>F2</strong>).</p>

            <p>At the final approach fix, bring the power back to
            30 percent torque, and your speed will start slowing
            towards 140 KIAS. Verify that the autofeather is armed
            (click the <strong>Autofeather</strong> switch into the ARM
            position).</p>

            <p>When you intercept the glideslope or enter the
            downwind, set the flaps to Approach (press <strong>F6</strong>,
            or click the flap lever) and put the landing gear down
            (press G, or click the landing gear lever).</p>

            <p>Bring the power back to 25 percent torque. Adjust
            power as you near the threshold to reduce speed to a
            target landing speed of 109 KIAS.</p>

            <p>At around 300 feet (91 meters) AGL, continue
            reducing power. If you've broken out on an ILS or the
            landing is assured on a visual approach, set flaps to
            Full.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>As you cross the threshold at around 50 feet (15
            meters) AGL, the power should be at 10 percent torque.
            (You can actually come back to idle power at this
            point, but the King Air will settle rather quickly. The
            best technique is to hold 10 percent torque until the
            main gear are on the pavement.)</p>

            <p>Raise the nose slightly to flare and slow the
            descent rate. Once the King Air mains are down, bring
            the power back to idle and hold some back pressure on
            the controls (hold the joystick aft, or press the
            <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>). The nose on the King Air tends to
            start down right away on touchdown, so you'll want to
            hold some back pressure to bring it down gently.</p>

            <p>The King Air decelerates rapidly on landing. Once
            the nose gear is on the runway, move the propeller
            levers into the bottom of the Ground Fine range (press
            <strong>CTRL+F2</strong>, or drag the levers).</p>

            <p>There's no need to use the full reverse propeller
            setting on landing unless the runway is short. If
            you're performing a short-field landing, move the
            propeller levers into Reverse once the nose gear is on
            the ground.</p>

            <p>Apply the brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key). Move
            the propeller levers to Ground Fine, exit the runway,
            and taxi to parking.</p>
