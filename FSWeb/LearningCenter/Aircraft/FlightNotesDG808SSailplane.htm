            <p>The DG&#8211;808S is a sailplane and has no engine, so it descends

			   you can maintain (or gain) altitude. Finding rising air is

				your skill.

			 <P>When being towed aloft by the tow plane, set the wing flaps
			  to +13 degrees and hold the joystick or yoke forward. At 80 km/h (43 knots),
			   gently ease back on the joystick. Normal towing speed is 120-130 km/h 
			   (65-70 knots), but for a cross-country tow, 190 km/h (103 knots) is safe.
			    At the higher tow speed, the flaps should be at a negative setting.</p>
				
			<p>When you reach 3,000 to 4,000 feet, deactivate slewing or release from
			the tow plane. Use the very effective Schempp-Hirth airbrakes
			 (press the SLASH [ / ] key, or drag the airbrake lever) to control 
			 speed while recovering to soaring flight. Lower the airbrakes 
			 once you level off (press the SLASH [ / ] key, or drag the 
			 spoiler lever).</p>
				
			<p>Alternatively, you can set your altitude and airspeed in the 
			Map. On the <strong>World</strong> menu, 
			click <strong>Map</strong>, and then enter the altitude 
			and airspeed in the appropriate boxes. Because you 
			  entered an airspeed, the aircraft won't pitch down when you turn 
			  off Slew mode and you won't need to use the 
			  airbrakes</p> <a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>The initial climb in the DG&#8211;808S is determined by 
			the tow plane speed. Cruise climb requires that you fly in an 
			area of rising air. You must fly the sailplane in an area where 
			the ground surface, heated by the sun, creates thermals. 
			Learning how to take advantage of rising air to remain 
			aloft or to climb can be one of the most enjoyable 
			  aspects of flying the sailplane. Pay attention to your 
			  variometer and altimeter when searching for areas of rising air.</p>
			  
			  <p><strong>Using the variometer</strong></p>
			  
			  <p>An instrument called the variometer helps you know when you're in
			rising air and how strong the lift is. Unlike a vertical speed indicator
			in a powered aircraft, which indicates the vertical speed of the aircraft,
			a compensated variometer indicates the vertical speed of the air through which
			a glider is moving.</p>
			  
			  <p>To use the variometer, fly into a thermal or into ridge lift 
			until the variometer's audio signal begins a series of beeps that 
			rise in pitch. This indicates you're flying in rising air. Watch the
			variometer rate gauge to see the rate at which the air is rising or
			falling.</p>
			
			<p>When the audio tone lowers in pitch and stops beeping, you know
			you're losing lift and should seek another area of rising air if you
			want to stay aloft or gain altitude. Flight Simulator has a 
			<a href="SoaringTowplanesThermalsRidgeLift.htm#ThermalVisibility">
			feature to make thermals visible</a> to aid in learning to fly 
			the glider.</p>

			  <p>When soaring in rising air, if you're trying to go for distance, 
			  fly at maximum L/D, which is approximately 57 knots (105 km/h) 
			  indicated airspeed (IAS). If you're trying to stay in the lift 
			  and just increase altitude, fly at minimum sink, which is 
			  approximately 46 knots (85 km/h).</p>
				
			<p>If you lose lift, you'll want to increase your speed by lowering
			 the nose and finding rising air again. The amount of increase 
			 in airspeed should be about half of your headwind component. If you 
			 have a 10-knot headwind, for example, increase your speed by 6 mph.</p>
			 
			<p>One of the most challenging sources of lift for the sailplane pilot 
			is a "thermal"&#8212;a rising current of warm air that is created in an area 
			where the sun's rays generate more heat than in surrounding areas. 
			For example, desert areas or brown fields generate more heat than 
			forests and green fields. These heated areas release heat into the 
			atmosphere and create columns of rising air.</p>				
				
			<a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally be determined by winds, weather, 
			and other factors. Long distance flight in a glider is dependent 
			on the ability to gain altitude in thermals and then maintain 
			the best speed for gliding distances. Without an engine,
			  rising air is the only thing that will keep you from heading earthward.</p>

            <p>When you can't find rising air, you have to manage the glide speed 
			of the aircraft. The numbers to remember for the DG&#8211;808S 
			are 45 to 1. For every one mile (1,609 meters) of altitude, the 
			sailplane can travel 45 miles (72.42 kilometers).</p>
			 
			 <p>That's if you have ideal conditions.</p>
			 
			 <p>You must include a safety margin for unfavorable winds 
			 and other factors; real-world soaring pilots use a safety 
			 margin of one-half or two-thirds of the 
			  aircraft's actual performance capability.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>You only get one opportunity at landing in a sailplane 
			(except in Flight Simulator, where you can use the Slew 
			feature to gain altitude). Therefore, you must plan your
			  descent so that you arrive over the airport at pattern altitude. 
			  It will take some experimentation to learn how far from the airport 
			  you can fly and still make a safe landing.</p>
							 
			 <p>Here's a test: use the Slew feature to gain one mile in altitude, 
			 and then slew 20 miles away from the airport (use the Global Positioning 
			 System&#8212;GPS&#8212;to be precise). See how well you do at 
			  getting back to the airport without having to slew again. You want to 
			  arrive in the airport pattern at around 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) 
			  above the airport elevation.</p><a name="Approach"></a>
			
			<p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>If you arrive in the airport vicinity with excess altitude, you 
			can use the airbrakes to increase your rate of descent 
			(press the SLASH [ / ] key, or drag the airbrake handle). Fly a 
			normal pattern at around 52 knots (96 km/h). Abeam the landing point, 
			extend the landing gear and set the flaps to +13 degrees (press G to 
			extend the landing gear and <strong>F7</strong> to extend flaps incrementally). 
			You should dump the water ballast before landing.</p><a name="Landing"></a>
			
            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Remember that if you carry excess speed on final approach, 
			the sailplane will keep flying longer than you want it to. 
			If necessary, deploy the airbrakes on final to allow
			 you to slow the aircraft and increase your rate of descent.</p>

            <p>As you cross the runway threshold, raise the nose slightly for 
			landing. If you haven't already deployed the airbrakes, do so just 
			before touchdown. This will spoil any lift that threatens to keep 
			the sailplane off the ground. Hold a level attitude close to the
			  ground, and let the sailplane settle to a smooth, level touchdown. 
			  Do not flare or the tailwheel will strike the ground, resulting 
			  in a rough landing.</p>
			
            <p>Once on the ground, use the rudder for directional control as 
			you roll out (twist the joystick, press the right or left rudder 
			pedal, or press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> 
			[right] on the numeric keypad).</p>
