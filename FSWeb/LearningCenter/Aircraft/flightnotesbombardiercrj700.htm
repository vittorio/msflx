            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 72,750 pounds (33,000 kilograms)<br>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>To taxi the CRJ700, use just enough power to get it
            rolling, and then bring the thrust levers back to idle.
            Idle thrust will keep you
            moving.</p>
			
			<p>Normal straight taxi speed should not exceed 20 knots.
			 For turns, 8- to 12-knot speeds are good for dry surfaces.</p>
			 
			<p>In Flight Simulator, rudder pedals (twist the joystick, 
			use the rudder pedals, or press 0 [left] or ENTER [right] 
			on the numeric keypad) are used for directional control 
			during taxiing. </p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>The following table lists recommended maneuvering speeds 
			for various flap settings. The minimum flap-retraction 
			altitude is 400 feet, but 1,000 feet complies with most 
			noise abatement procedures. When extending or retracting 
			the flaps, use the next appropriate flap setting depending 
			on whether you're slowing down or speeding up.</p>
			
		<pre>

Flaps 1       200
Flaps 8       200

		</pre><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>All of the following occurs quite rapidly. Read
            through the procedure several times before attempting
            it in the plane so you know what to expect.</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist, and set
            flaps to 20 degrees (press <strong>F7</strong>, or drag
            the flaps lever). With the aircraft aligned with the
            runway centerline, advance the throttles (press
            <strong>F3</strong>, or drag the levers) to approximately 40
            percent N1. This allows the engines to spool up to a
            point where uniform acceleration to takeoff thrust will
            occur on both engines. The exact amount of initial
            setting is not as important as setting symmetrical
            thrust.</p>

            <p>After the engines are stabilized, advance the thrust
            levers to takeoff thrust&#8212;generally 91.5
            percent N1 (less with high outside air
            temperatures).</p>

            <p>Directional control is maintained by use of the
            rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder
            pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            [right] on the numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>At V1, approximately 134 knots indicated airspeed
            (KIAS), is decision speed. Above this speed, it may not
            be possible to stop the aircraft on the runway in case
            of a rejected takeoff (RTO).</p>

            <p>At 134 KIAS, smoothly pull the
            stick back (use the joystick or yoke, or press the
            <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to raise the nose to 10 degrees
            above the horizon. Hold this pitch attitude and be
            careful not to over-rotate.</p>

            <p>At V2, approximately 146 KIAS, the aircraft has
            reached its takeoff safety speed. This is the minimum
            safe flying speed should an engine fail. Hold this
            speed until you get a positive rate of climb.</p>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb (both vertical speed and altitude are
            increasing), retract the landing gear (press G on the
            keyboard, or drag the landing gear lever). The aircraft
            will quickly accelerate to the flap-retraction speed.</p>
			
			<a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>As you retract the flaps, set climb power of approximately
			 90 percent N1 (press <strong>F2</strong>, use the throttle control on your 
			 joystick, or drag the thrust levers). Maintain 6- or 7-degrees 
			 nose-up pitch attitude to climb at 250 kts until reaching 
			 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), and then maintain 290 KIAS 
			 (.74 mach) to your cruising altitude.</p>
			 <a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally determined by winds,
            weather, and other factors. You might want to use these
            factors in your flight planning if you have created
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>You can cruise
            as high as FL450 (the airplane is certified to 51,000
            feet), but the only payoffs for burning the fuel it
            takes to get there would be getting above a weather
            system or taking advantage of especially favorable
            winds.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for FL350. When
            you approach your cruising altitude, begin leveling off
            at about 50 feet (15 meters) below your target
            altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the CRJ700
            in cruise if you use the autopilot. The autopilot can
            hold the altitude, speed, heading, or navaid course you
            specify. For more information about using the
            autopilot, see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingAnAutopilot.htm">Using an
            Autopilot</a>.</p>

            <p>Normal cruise speed is 0.77 Mach. Set power at
            around 90 percent N1.</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher in the thin, cold air.</p>
			<a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing when to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude.) Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            35,000 feet (10,668 meters) to sea level:<br>
            35,000 minus the last three zeros is 35.<br>
            35 x 3=105</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 105
            nautical miles from your destination, maintaining a
            speed of 250 KIAS and a descent rate of 1,500 to 2,000
            feet per minute, with thrust set at flight idle to 53
            percent N1. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>To descend, disengage the autopilot if you turned it
            on during cruise (or use the autopilot hold features
            and let it fly for you). Reduce power to idle, and
            lower the nose slightly. Remember not to exceed the
            regulation speed limit of 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). You may have to adjust power to
            maintain your speed and rate of descent. Continue this
            profile down to the beginning of the approach phase of
            flight.</p>

            <a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>You want to set your aircraft configuration (flaps and 
			landing gear) and establish your target speed well ahead. 
			Excess speed in the CRJ will require a level flight segment to slow down.</p>
			
			<p>On an instrument approach, you want to be configured for 
			landing and have your speed stable by the final approach fix 
			(where you intercept the glide slope), usually about five miles 
			from touchdown.</p>
			
			<p>Set flaps to 1 (press <strong>F7</strong>, or drag the flaps indicator 
			or lever) when airspeed is reduced below the minimum 
			flaps-up maneuvering speed. Normally, this would be when 
			entering the downwind leg or at the initial approach fix, 
			so you should be at the desired airspeed by this point. 
			You can then continue adding flaps as you get down to the 
			speed limits for each setting.</p>
			
			<p>Flaps 45 is the setting for normal landings.</p>
			 
			<p>Intercept the glide slope from below, and extend 
			the landing gear (press G, or drag the landing gear 
			lever) when the glide slope needle is less than or 
			equal to one dot high.</p>
			
			<p>The proper final approach speed varies with weight, 
			but a good target at typical operating weight is 135 to 140 KIAS.</p>
			
			<p>With landing gear down and flaps at 45 degrees, set 
			the power at 55 to 60 percent N1. This configuration should 
			hold airspeed with a good descent angle toward the runway. 
			Use small power adjustments and pitch changes to stay on the glide path.</p>

            <p>When you're approaching the normal descent point on
            a visual approach, or one dot below the glide slope
            approaching the final approach fix on an ILS approach,
            extend the landing gear.</p>

            <p>Establish 140 knots, your
            final approach speed. As you intercept the glide slope,
            set 40 degrees of flaps. This configuration should hold
            airspeed at 140 knots with a good descent angle toward
            the runway.</p>

            <p>Hold 140 knots all the way down on final approach.
            Use small power adjustments to stay on the glide path.
            Look for a descent rate of about 700 fpm.</p>

            <p>At about 50 feet above the runway and past the
            runway threshold, bring the thrust levers to idle. Hold
            the pitch attitude you've used during final approach.
            Don't try to raise or lower the nose. 
			
			When all wheels are down, move the Flight Spoiler lever into 
			the <strong>MAX</strong> position (press the <strong>SLASH</strong> [ /
            ]), add reverse thrust (press <strong>F2</strong>, or drag
            the thrust levers into the reverse position), and apply
            brakes.</p>

            <p>Make sure you come out of reverse thrust (press
            <strong>F1</strong>, or drag the thrust levers), and lower the
            spoilers as airspeed drops below 60 knots. Exit the
            runway, and taxi to parking.</p>
			
			<p>Once you're clear of the runway and as you taxi to the 
			terminal, retract the flaps (press F6, or drag the flaps lever) 
			and lower the spoilers (press the SLASH [ / ], or click the brake lever).</p>
