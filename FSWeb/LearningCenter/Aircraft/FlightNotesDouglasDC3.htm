            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day

            <p>Takeoff: 1,600 feet (488 meters) no flaps<br>
            Landing: 2,500 feet (762 meters) approach flaps
            extended (Full-45&#186;)</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 25,000 pounds (11,340 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>

            Runway: hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.

            <p class="SubHead">Engine startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard. If you want to do the
            startup procedures manually, follow the checklist
            procedures on the kneeboard.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The throttle levers on the DC&#8211;3 control
              engine power, from idle to takeoff power. Moving the
              throttles forward increases engine power.</li>

              <li>The propeller levers are operated forward and aft
              for setting the required rpm for various phases of
              flight. The normal range is from 1,600 to 2,500
              rpm.</li>
            </ul><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>For a taildragger the DC&#8211;3 has good visibility
            over the nose, but you may need to raise the seat
            (press <strong>SHIFT+ENTER</strong>). The normal power setting
            for taxiing is between 800 and 1,000 rpm (press
            <strong>F2</strong> on the keyboard, or drag the power levers).
            You can lock the tailwheel during any long, straight
            portions of the taxi path to make directional control
            easier.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>Unless the runway is short, a no-flaps takeoff is
            standard for the DC&#8211;3. On the DC&#8211;3,
            available flap settings are 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and Full.
            The flaps cannot be stopped at an intermediate point
            between these positions. See the kneeboard for the flap
            operating speeds.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist. With the
            aircraft aligned with the runway centerline, check that
            the propeller levers are full forward, and the
            tailwheel is locked. Directional control is maintained
            by use of the rudder pedals (twist the joystick, use
            rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong> (left) or <strong>ENTER</strong>
            (right) on the numeric keypad). Takeoff power is 48&quot; Hg
            and 2750 rpm at sea level in standard atmosphere.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>At approximately 50 knots (58 mph), the tail will
              come up (use the joystick or yoke or press <strong>UP
              ARROW</strong> to apply some forward pressure).</li>

              <li>V1, approximately 84 knots (97 mph), is decision
              speed. Takeoff with one engine inoperable is
              permitted at 84 knots and above. Gently pull back on
              the controls to take off. Hold this speed until you
              get a positive rate of climb.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude
            are increasing), retract the landing gear (press
            <strong>G</strong> or drag the landing gear lever) and allow the
            speed to increase.</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>At 105 knots (121 mph), reduce power to 35&quot; Hg
            manifold pressure and reduce props to 2,350 rpm. (Press
            <strong>F2</strong>, use the throttle control on your joystick,
            or drag the throttle levers to set the manifold
            pressure. Press <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> or drag the propeller
            levers to set the rpm.) At a safe altitude, allow the
            airspeed to increase to 115 to 120 knots (132 to 138
            mph). Maintain this speed while climbing to your
            cruising altitude.</p>

            <p>The optimum DC&#8211;3 climb speed is 105 knots (120
            mph). A speed of 115 to 120 knots allows some engine
            cooling benefits. Speed will decrease with altitude.
            Adjust the mixture and throttle settings as you climb
            to maintain the best rate of climb.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

                  <p>The instrument panel of a Douglas DC&#8211;3
                  might seem unorganized compared to the consistent
                  panel design found in modern airplane cockpits.
                  The familiar arrangement that pilots know today
                  (airspeed indicator, attitude indicator,
                  altimeter/turn coordinator, heading indicator,
                  vertical speed indicator) is a fairly recent
                  development. Back in the 1930s, each DC&#8211;3
                  panel&#8217;s unique arrangement reflected its
                  owner&#8217;s preferences. If you&#8217;re used
                  to flying the modern airplanes in the Flight
                  Simulator fleet, the DC&#8211;3 panel will takes
                  some getting used to. But if you fly any airplane
                  long enough, its cockpit will seem like home.</p>

            <p>Let's say you've filed a flight plan for 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). Approaching your cruising altitude,
            begin leveling off at about 50 ft (15 meters) below
            your target altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the
            DC&#8211;3 in cruise if you use the autopilot. The
            autopilot in the DC&#8211;3 can hold the pitch attitude
            and heading you specify. For more information on using
            the DC&#8211;3 autopilot, see Using the Autopilot
            below.</p>

            <p>A typical cruise power setting in the DC&#8211;3 for
            the parameters chosen above is 28&quot; Hg manifold pressure
            and 2,050 rpm. That will give you an indicated airspeed
            of around 140 knots and a fuel burn of 92 gallons per
            hour.</p>

            <p>Remember that true airspeed is actually higher than
            indicated airspeed in the thin, cold air. Experiment
            with power settings to find the setting that maintains
            the cruise speed and fuel consumption you want at the
            altitude that you choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with no less than
            20&quot; of manifold pressure and 2,050 rpm. A good rule for
            determining when to start your descent is the 3-to-1
            rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            10,000 feet (3,048 meters) to sea level:<br>
            10,000 minus the last three zeros is 10.<br>
            10x3=30</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 30 nautical
            miles from your destination, maintaining a speed of 135
            knots (155 mph; it may not indicate this high until you
            descend into denser air) and a descent rate of 500 ft
            per minute. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>In the DC&#8211;3, adjust thrust during descent to
            maintain 135 knots (use the joystick throttle or press
            <strong>F2</strong> to decrease thrust or <strong>F3</strong> to increase
            thrust). The propeller levers should remain at 2,050
            rpm.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>As you near the approach phase of flight, bring the
            power back to 20&quot; if you haven't already, and fly at
            105 knots on downwind. When you intercept the glide
            slope or enter the downwind, set the flaps to 1/4
            (press <strong>F6</strong> or click the flap lever) and put the
            landing gear down (press <strong>G</strong> or click the landing
            gear lever). If the landing gear malfunctions, press
            <strong>CTRL+G</strong> repeatedly to manually lower the
            gear.</p>

            <p>Abeam the touchdown point, lower the flaps to 3/4.
            Turning base, go to full flaps. Over the fence you
            should reduce speed to 90 knots (104 mph).</p><a name=
            "Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>As you cross the threshold at around 50 feet (15
            meters) AGL, the power should be at 15&quot; Hg and 2,050
            rpm.</p>

            <p>Raise the nose slightly to flare and slow the
            descent rate. Bring the power back to idle and hold
            some back pressure on the controls (hold the joystick
            aft or press <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>). As soon as the main
            wheels contact the ground, the propeller levers should
            be set to full forward. The tail on the DC&#8211;3
            tends to start down as you slow so you'll want to hold
            some forward pressure on the controls to let the tail
            down gently.</p>

            <p>Once the tail wheel is on the runway, apply the
            brakes (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key) to slow to taxi
            speed, exit the runway, and taxi to
            parking.</p><a name="UsingtheAutopilot"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Using the Autopilot</p>

            <p>This section discusses autopilot features specific
            to the Douglas DC&#8211;3 (for a general discussion of
            autopilots, see <strong>Autopilots</strong> in the <strong>Learning
            Center</strong>). The autopilot settings in Flight Simulator
            are not persistent or saved, so if a flight is
            reloaded, the pitch and heading will return to 0
            degrees.</p>

            <p>The autopilot has two gauges, an on/off switch, and
            a power light to indicate that the unit is functioning.
            If the master switch is off, the power for the
            autopilot is not available.</p>

            <p>On the left side of the autopilot is a wheel-style
            directional gyro with an adjustment knob immediately
            below it. Immediately above the directional gyro wheel
            is another knob, the <strong>Autopilot Heading
            Reference</strong>. Rotate the Heading Reference knob on the
            upper right of the directional gyro to set a desired
            heading (clockwise to turn right, counterclockwise to
            turn left). When the autopilot is on, the aircraft will
            turn to and follow the course set by the user on the
            Autopilot Heading Reference. The default setting for
            the Autopilot Heading Reference is zero degrees.</p>

            <p>On the right side of the autopilot is a standard
            attitude indicator with an adjustment knob and a cage
            knob. The instrument face also has an <strong>Autopilot
            Pitch Reference</strong> in the shape of a slender
            horizontal window. Rotate the Pitch Reference knob on
            the upper right of the attitude indicator to set the
            desired pitch angle. When the autopilot is engaged the
            aircraft will hold the pitch angle set by the pilot.The
            default setting for the Autopilot Pitch Reference is
            zero degrees.</p>

            <p>The autopilot essentially holds a given
            <strong>attitude</strong>, not an <strong>altitude</strong>. If the
            aircraft is disrupted by turbulence, the autopilot will
            attempt to return the aircraft to the selected attitude
            and heading. If gyro drift is turned on in the
            <strong>Realism</strong> dialog box, the autopilot will drift off
            course as the directional gyro drifts.</p>

            <p>If you use the keyboard command for altitude hold
            (<strong>CTRL+Z</strong>) the autopilot will behave like a more
            modern unit, holding altitude (at a constant power
            setting) even though the unit is designed to hold
            attitude. You will not be able to override the
            autopilot control of the aircraft by manipulating the
            stick and rudder. You must turn off the autopilot to
            regain control of the aircraft.</p>
