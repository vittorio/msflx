            <p>Turbine engines were developed because, propellers
            and piston engines have limits for effectively pushing
            and combusting thin air at high altitudes. Turbine
            engines, however, excel at high altitudes because they
            compress air before combustion, thus increasing
            high-altitude performance. And flying high in thin air
            translates to better fuel efficiency, an extended
            flying range, and faster and smoother flying high above
            the turbulence of most weather. That's why turbine
            engines, whether turboprops or turbofans, have replaced
            piston engines on most large aircraft. Turbines have
            also become increasingly popular on smaller executive
            aircraft with the development of small, efficient
            turbofan engines.</p><a name="How It Works"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">How It Works</p>

            <p>The turbines in a turbine engine are fan-like
            structures. Blades arrayed around a shaft catch air
            flowing through the engine and turn the central engine
            shaft. Most modern turbine engines have several
            turbines that compress the incoming air at separate
            stages before it reaches the combustion chamber.
            Additional turbines in the exhaust area of the engine
            use the energy from the exhaust and keep the turbine
            shaft rotating.</p>

            <p>All turbine engines operate according to the same
            basic principle. A combustible mixture of fuel and air
            is drawn into the engine. The air and fuel mix in a
            combustion chamber, where the mixture is ignited. The
            hot exhaust gas shoots out the rear of the engine at
            high speed, pushing the airplane ahead. As the hot air
            flows through the engine, it turns additional turbines
            in the exhaust stream, which keep the shaft spinning
            quickly, usually more than 10,000 revolutions per
            minute (rpm).</p><a name="Turbofan Engines"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Turbofan Engines</p>

            <p>A turbofan engine has a large-diameter turbine at
            the front of the engine that accelerates a large mass
            of air that flows around the central engine core and
            out the back. This arrangement makes more efficient use
            of fuel and is much quieter than older turbojet
            technology.</p><a name="Turboprop Engines"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Turboprop Engines</p>

            <p>A turboprop engine is a jet engine attached to a
            propeller. The high-speed turbines generate an enormous
            amount of power that is transmitted to the propeller
            through a gear-reduction system. The propeller is
            really a large fan turned by the turbine. Turboprop
            engines are much more efficient than pure jet engines
            at speeds in the 250mph to 350 mph (400km/h to 560
            km/h) range. At higher speeds, propellers lose their
            efficiency, and pure jet engines are a better
            choice.</p><a name="Turbine Engine Controls"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Turbine Engine Controls</p>

            <p>From a pilot's perspective, turbine engines are much
            easier to operate than piston engines. Aircraft
            equipped with turbofan engines&#8212;like the
            Bombardier Learjet 45 and Boeing
            737&#8211;800&#8212;have a single power control: the
            thrust levers. Automatic fuel control systems take care
            of mixing fuel and air in the combustion chamber, and
            there's no propeller control to worry about.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind, however, that it takes a while for jet
            engines to develop full power or "spool up." It's very
            important to anticipate the need for more
            power.</p><a name="Watch the Temperatures"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Watch the Temperatures</p>

            <p>By far the most important consideration when
            operating a turbine engine is temperature control. If
            you shove the thrust levers forward on takeoff, you can
            easily overheat the engines. If you don't cause an
            engine failure, at the least you'll run up a very large
            bill for inspection and repair of critical engine
            components. So watch the exhaust gas temperature (EGT)
            and inlet turbine temperature (ITT) gauges carefully
            when you add power. Keep the needles out of the red
            zones.</p><a name="Reverse Thrust"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Reverse Thrust</p>

            <p>The Learjet 45, Bombardier CRJ, Boeing 737&#8211;800, and the Boeing
            747&#8211;400 are
            equipped with thrust reversers that deflect the
            engines' exhaust forward to help the airplane slow down
            after landing.</p>
