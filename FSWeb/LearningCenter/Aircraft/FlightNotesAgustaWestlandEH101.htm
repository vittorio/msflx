            <p>Flying rotary-wing aircraft is quite different from
            flying fixed-wing aircraft. Not only is mastering helicopter flight
            challenging, but it offers some of
            the best flying Flight Simulator has to
            offer. There's nothing like threading your way through
            the skyscrapers of downtown Dubai or Singapore, and
            with practice, you'll be able to make rooftop landings.
            For more information about the fundamentals of
            rotary-wing flight, see <a href=
            "../AdvancedFlyingSkills/FlyingHelicopters.htm">Flying
            Helicopters</a>.</p>

            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight under International 
			Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Controlling the Helicopter using a
            Joystick</p>

            <p>You can use a joystick to operate the basic flight
            and power controls for the EH101
            helicopter.</p>

            <p>The stick part of the joystick controls the cyclic,
            which controls the helicopter's pitch attitude in
            flight and movement over the ground while in a
            hover.</p>

            <p>With some types of joysticks you can twist the stick to apply
            left or right anti-torque pedal inputs. Anti-torque
            pedals are used to yaw the nose of a helicopter side to
            side by adjusting the pitch of the blades on the tail
            rotor. Push the left pedal and the helicopter's nose
            rotates to the left. Pushing the right pedal has
            the opposite effect.</p>

            <p>The lever, or wheel, on the joystick, which you use
            as a throttle in airplanes, is the collective when
            flying a helicopter. This controls pitch in the main
            rotor blades collectively. Its primary function is to
            control altitude.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sophisticated turbine-engine
            helicopters have all but eliminated the throttle from
            the collective lever. Computerized mechanisms control
            the power necessary to maintain rotor rpm appropriate
            to the collective setting chosen by the pilot. This is
            essentially how the collective works in Flight
            Simulator. The fuel control unit automatically adjusts
            the throttle (engine speed) as you move the
            collective.</p>

            <p>To control the throttle manually, press
            <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> to decrease power and <strong>CTRL+F3</strong> to
            increase power. (This procedure is not recommended
            unless you're familiar with helicopter operation.)
            Monitor the power turbine gauges to set engine power as
            a percentage of power turbine rpm.</p><a name=
            "RequiredRunwayLength"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Practically speaking, the required runway length for
            any helicopter is the length of the fuselage.</p>
			
			<p>The distance required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 34,400 pounds (15,604 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176;C<br> Lower weights and temperatures
            will result in better performance, as will having a
            headwind component. Higher altitudes and temperatures
            degrade performance.<br>
			Runway: hard surface</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, you can return to engines ON by
            clicking the Fuel Valve Switch or by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+F4</strong>.</p><a name=
            "HoveringandTaxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Hovering and Taxiing</p>

            <p>Unlike a helicopter that has skids and no wheels,
			the EH101 can be taxied on its wheels. Use the tail rotor
			pedals for directional control, the collective for speed, and forward
			cyclic to get moving. You can also hover taxi.</p>
			
			<p>Taxiing in a helicopter is often called hover
            taxiing. This means that you hover just a few feet
            off the ground with a forward motion. Generally, you
            would use this technique when taxiing from one area to
            another on the airport or if you needed to move the
            helicopter a short distance.</p>

            <p>Remember that the cyclic controls the direction in
            which the helicopter moves. The EH101 hovers in a tail-low 
			attitude, due to its forward-canted main rotor in the static 
			position. Use small, smooth adjustments of the collective to
            maintain the proper altitude. To keep the nose straight, apply pressure to the
            left or right anti-torque pedal.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Note the wind direction and speed. If possible, plan
            to take off directly into the wind to minimize sideways
            drift and to increase the helicopter's performance
            during takeoff and climb.</p>

            <p>Wind blowing through the main rotor disk has the
            same effect as forward airspeed. For example, if the
            helicopter is facing into a 10- to 15-knot wind, the
            rotor experiences effective translational lift (ETL)
            even when the aircraft is on the surface.</p>

            <p>When you're ready to make a vertical takeoff, use
            scenery objects as a guide. Note a point in the
            distance (such as a building, tower, or gas pump). Use
            that point and the outside horizon as references to
            help you maintain the helicopter's alignment and
            attitude as you lift off.</p>

            <p>Set the cyclic (joystick handle) in an approximately
            neutral position. Set the collective in the full down
            position (use the joystick throttle, or press
            <strong>F2</strong>).</p>

            <p>Smoothly and slowly raise the collective (press
            <strong>F3</strong>, or push forward on the joystick throttle).
            The helicopter should become light on the wheels as you
            reach 40 to 60 percent torque. Ease into this range
            smoothly and slowly.</p>

            <p>As the helicopter's weight comes off the wheels, it
            will start to drift and turn to the right. Hold the
            collective steady at this point, and use slight left
            cyclic pressure to hold the helicopter in position.</p>

            <p>Apply left pedal pressure (twist the joystick to the
            left, press the left rudder pedal, or press <strong>0</strong> on
            the numeric keypad) to compensate for the torque from
            the main rotor.</p>

            <p>Keep your attention outside the helicopter, and
            focus on the horizon and other visual clues. To
            continue the liftoff, smoothly increase the
            collective.</p>

            <p>Anticipate the need to add left pedal as you lift
            off and make small, smooth corrections with the cyclic
            (move the joystick, or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong> or
            <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) and pedals (twist the joystick, or
            press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the
            numeric keypad) to maintain heading and position.</p>

            <p>Hold the helicopter wheels about 3 feet (1 meter)
            above the ground. You want to stay low in case the
            engine fails and also to keep the helicopter in 
			<a name="ground effect" id="ground effect" href="../Glossary_bottom.htm">ground effect</a>.</p>

            <p>Raise or lower the collective to maintain altitude.
            Maintain the correct attitude using light, small cyclic
            pressures, and use the anti-torque pedals to keep the
            helicopter's nose from rotating.</p>

            <p>Anticipate corrections to compensate for wind.
            You'll need slight forward cyclic pressure if you take
            off into a headwind, left pressure with a left
            crosswind, and so forth.</p>

            <p>When you're ready to continue the takeoff, gently
            apply a small amount of forward cyclic (push the
            joystick forward, or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong>) to
            lower the nose and begin moving forward along the
            departure path. The helicopter may tend to settle as
            you start forward. Compensate by adding slight up
            collective (increase the joystick throttle setting, or
            press <strong>F3</strong>).</p>

            <p>As airspeed reaches 10 to 15 knots, the helicopter
            enters effective translational lift. The nose tends to
            yaw left and pitch up slightly. Apply some forward
            cyclic to prevent the nose from rising.</font></p>

            <p>Add some left lateral cyclic (push the joystick
            left, or press the <strong>LEFT ARROW</strong>) to prevent the
            helicopter from drifting right, and apply right pedal
            pressure (twist the joystick to the right, use the
            right rudder pedal, or press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the
            numeric keypad) to maintain heading. The helicopter
            continues climbing and accelerating.</p>

            <p>If you feel like you're juggling a lot at this
            point, you are. Helicopter flying is not easy, and it's
            been described as an activity similar to trying to
            balance one ball on top of another.</p>

            <p>To accelerate and maintain rate of climb, increase
            collective and add slight forward cyclic. On the
            crosswind leg, depart the traffic pattern or return for
            another landing by turning 90 degrees again to join the
            downwind leg.</p><a name="Hoist"></a>

            <p>The EH101 can pick up and carry objects in the Flight 
			Simulator world. There are Missions in <em>Flight Simulator X: Acceleration</em>
			with objectives to use the EH101's hoist or sling to move objects.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> some Missions require you to pick
			up and carry objects with a sling. In these Missions, the sling is	
			already suspended from the bottom of the EH101 and you cannot raise
			or lower the sling. Hover close to the object to be picked up and 
			toggle the sling hook into <strong>Attach</strong> mode.</p>
			
			<p>To practice picking up and carrying objects, fly the 
			<strong>Slingload Tutorial</strong> mission.</p>

			<p>When you toggle the hoist into <strong>Attach</strong> mode, you must be close
			enough to the object for the cable to automatically grab the object.</p>
			
			<p>When raising an object to place it inside the helicopter (as when 
			rescuing an injured person), you obviously raise the cable all the way
			in and retract the hoist arm.</p>
			
			<p>But you can also "slingload" an object by flying with it suspended
			on the cable beneath the helicopter. This requires great care to prevent
			wild oscillations of the load, which could break the cable or cause you
			to lose control of the aircraft.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>The AgustaWestland EH101 can achieve a maximum
            rate of climb of about 1,964 feet per minute at sea
            level under standard weather conditions. 65
            knots is a good climb speed because it's also the speed
            to use for autorotation.</font></p>

            <p>For a normal climb, adjust the collective (use the
            joystick throttle, or press <strong>F3</strong>) for a torque
            setting about 10 percent above that required to
            maintain a hover in ground effect.</font></p>

            <p>Under standard conditions and at typical operating
            weights, you'll need 80 to 85 percent torque for a
            normal climb. Use the cyclic (the joystick or the ARROW
            keys) to set pitch attitude.</font></p>

            <p>Monitor the engine instruments and smoothly add
            collective to maintain climb power as your altitude
            increases.</p>

            <p>Keep the following considerations in mind as you
            climb:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use the collective to control power and the rate
              of the climb.</li>

              <li>Monitor engine instruments closely to ensure that
              you stay within operating limits.</li>

              <li>Maintain attitude (thus airspeed) by looking out
              to the horizon. Focusing on a point too close to the
              nose makes it difficult to maintain the proper
              aircraft attitude.</li>

              <li>Use the cyclic to control airspeed (and the
              helicopter's attitude) and the anti-torque pedals to
              maintain heading or to establish a crab angle as
              necessary to fly a constant ground track.</li>

              <li>Use the anti-torque pedals to maintain 
              coordinated flight. A slip or skid severely
              degrades climb performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To level off from a climb, start decreasing
            collective about 50 feet (15 meters) below the altitude
            at which you want to level off. Add right anti-torque
            pedal as you decrease torque to the cruise setting
            (about 80 percent torque). Use the cyclic to maintain
            cruising airspeed. Apply forward cyclic to increase
            speed and aft cyclic to slow down.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Under typical conditions, you should set the
            collective to 80 percent torque for efficient cruising
            flight. At this power setting, 5 percent below the
            maximum-allowed continuous power setting, the EH101 
			typically cruises at about 150 knots.</p>

            <p>To maintain the desired track over the ground, use
            the anti-torque pedals to turn the helicopter into the
            wind and establish the correct crab angle.</p>

            <p>To turn, use the cyclic to bank the helicopter.</p>

            <p>Use the anti-torque pedals to keep the helicopter in
            coordinated flight. If the
            inclinometer in the turn coordinator shows a slip or a
            skid, apply left or right pedal pressure as necessary
            to center the ball.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>To descend at a comfortable rate without building
            too much speed, you must decrease main rotor pitch by
            lowering the collective (use the joystick throttle, or
            press <strong>F2</strong>). Anticipate the need for the right
            anti-torque pedal as you decrease torque.</p>

            <p>The nose drops as you lower collective, so remember
            that you'll need to add a little aft cyclic (pull the
            joystick aft, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to
            maintain the correct pitch attitude and airspeed. Don't
            add too much aft cyclic, however: the aircraft will
            climb.</p>

            <p>Note that as you descend, the engine produces more
            power. Monitor
            the engine instruments and smoothly reduce collective
            to continue your descent.</FONT></p>

            <p>To level off from a descent, start increasing
            collective about 50 feet (15 meters) above the altitude
            at which you want to level off. Add left anti-torque
            pedal as you increase torque to the cruise setting
            (about 80 percent torque). Use the cyclic to maintain
            cruising airspeed. Apply forward cyclic to increase
            speed and aft cyclic to slow down.</p><a name=
            "Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>

            <p>Approaches in a helicopter need to factor
            local traffic and terrain as well as a target
            speed and configuration. Enter the airport traffic area
            in a safe manner that avoids obstacles, and follow the
            landing procedures as described.</p><a name=
            "Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>To land the EH101, reverse the procedure for
            a normal takeoff. That is, fly an approach from a
            500-foot (150-meter) traffic pattern, enter a hover at
            about 3 feet (1 meter) above the ground, and then
            slowly and smoothly lower the aircraft to the
            ground.</p>

            <p>Following this procedure helps you establish good
            habits and makes it easier to achieve smooth,
            consistent landings.</p>

            <p>Review the landing checklist on the Kneeboard.</p>

            <p>Fly a modified traffic pattern that avoids the flow
            of fixed-wing traffic.</p>

            <p>During the first half of the approach, decrease
            power by lowering the collective (use the joystick
            throttle, or press <strong>F2</strong>). During the second half of the
            approach, you must smoothly increase power to arrive at
            the 3-foot (1-meter) hover just as you set hover power,
            usually 70 to 75 percent torque.</font></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Fly the downwind leg at 500 feet (150 meters) at
              100 knots.</li>

              <li>Turn to the base leg, decelerate to 70 knots, and
              then descend to 300 feet (90 meters).</li>

              <li>Turn final at 300 feet (90 meters), and
              decelerate to 52 to 60 knots.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A descent angle of 10 to 12 degrees provides good
            obstacle clearance and helps you keep the landing area
            in sight.</p>

            <p>Adjust the collective to control rate of descent.
            Increase collective (use the joystick throttle, or
            press <strong>F3</strong>) to reduce the rate of descent;
            decrease collective (use the joystick throttle or press
            <strong>F2</strong>) slightly to increase rate of descent.</p>

            <p>Use the cyclic (the joystick or <strong>ARROW</strong> keys)
            to adjust the rate of closure with your landing spot.
            Apply slight aft cyclic to reduce the rate of closure;
            forward pressure increases the rate of closure. The
            ideal forward rate of travel is that of a normal
            walk.</p>

            <p>Continue the approach until the rate of closure with
            the landing spot accelerates. Begin dissipating forward
            speed by applying smooth, slight back pressure on the
            cyclic. As you decelerate, anticipate the need to
            decrease collective to maintain altitude.</p>

            <p>As airspeed drops to 10 to 15 knots, the aircraft
            will lose effective translational lift. You must add up
            collective to compensate for the loss of lift. You'll
            also need to add left anti-torque pedal pressure as you
            increase collective pitch.</p>

            <p>Transition to the hover over the landing spot. Enter
            a 3-foot (1-meter) hover over the spot where you want
            to land. Slowly lower the collective and allow the
            helicopter to settle onto the landing spot. Once the
            aircraft is down, lower the collective all the way
            (move the joystick throttle full aft, or press
            <strong>F1</strong>).</p><a name="Autorotation"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Autorotation</p>

            <p>Autorotation in a helicopter is the equivalent of a
            power-off glide in an airplane. The following
            procedures helps you land after a simulated engine failure.</p>

            <p>During autorotation, it's important to maintain
            rotor rpm so you have lift available to cushion the
            landing. You must also maintain the correct forward
            speed so that you can reach a suitable landing area and
            flare to reduce the rate of descent before ground
            contact.</p>

            <p>To achieve the proper glide ratio and travel the greatest
            distance, maintain 65 KIAS, the maximum-distance glide
            speed. Use the cyclic (the joystick or <strong>ARROW</strong>
            keys) to adjust pitch to maintain best glide.</p>

            <p>Here are some tips to help you fly the EH101
            in an autorotation:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>If the engine fails, you must decrease collective
              smoothly and immediately to preserve and maintain
              rotor rpm (use the joystick throttle, or press
              <strong>F1</strong>). Remember&#8212;smoothly. If you abruptly
              lower the collective, the helicopter develops a
              high sink rate. Establish a glide at 65 KIAS.</li>

              <li>Stabilized rotor RPM in autorotation at 1,000
              feet (305 meters) should be 93 to 95 percent under
              ISA conditions.</li>

              <li>As the helicopter descends to 75 to 50 feet, (23
              to 15 meters) apply gentle aft cyclic (pull the
              joystick aft, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>) to
              establish about a 10-degree nose-up attitude until
              approximately 15 ft (5 m) above the ground. After
              ground speed is reduced, apply forward cyclic to
              level the helicopter.</li>

              <li>Cushion the landing by adding some collective
              (move the joystick throttle forward, or press
              <strong>F3</strong>) as required.</li>

              <li>To maintain heading, you'll need to add right
              pedal.</li>

              <li>After ground contact, center the cyclic and
              gently lower the collective.</li>

              <li>Remember this sequence: Flare, pitch, level, and
              cushion.</li>
