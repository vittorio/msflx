            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>Takeoff: 813 feet (248 meters)<br>
            Landing: 1,798 feet (548 meters)</p>

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient
            temperature. The figures here are conservative and
            assume:</p>

            <p>Weight: 2,095 pounds (950 kilograms)<br>
            Altitude: sea level<br>
            Wind: no headwind<br>
            Temperature: 15&#176; C<br>
            Runway: hard surface</p>

            <p>Lower weights and temperatures will result in better
            performance, as will having a headwind component.
            Higher altitudes and temperatures will degrade
            performance.</p><a name="EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine is running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engine down, you can initiate
            an auto-startup sequence by pressing <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If
            you want to do the startup procedures manually, use the
            checklist on the Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>While taxiing, the power should be set at around
            1000 rpm (prop and mixture are full forward). As you
            move down the taxiway, turn the nose right and left for
            directional control by using the rudder (twist the
            joystick, use the rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong>
            [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the numeric
            keypad).</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>The 300S doesn't have flaps.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist.</p>

            <p>With the aircraft aligned with the runway
            centerline, advance the throttle control to full power.
            Keep a slight forward pressure on the stick (use the
            joystick or yoke, or press the <strong>UP ARROW</strong>), and
            the tail will come up fairly soon at around 40 knots
            indicated airspeed (KIAS). Then, rotate slightly
            nose-up (use the joystick or yoke, or press the <strong>DOWN
            ARROW</strong>), and the plane will become airborne at
            around 70 KIAS.</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Here's where the fun starts with the 300S. After
            takeoff, level out and let the speed build to around
            120 KIAS, which will happen quite quickly. Then, check
            out the performance of this amazing airplane. You can
            pull up and through the vertical into an Immelmann
            right over the runway.</p>

            <p>Experiment with throttle settings. You'll find the
            Extra is extremely responsive to throttle changes; this
            will aid you as you learn to maneuver this little sport
            plane.</p>

            <p>If you're using the Extra to cruise cross-country,
            reduce power after takeoff to 25 inches of manifold
            pressure (use the joystick throttle, press <strong>F2</strong>,
            or drag the throttle control). Raise the nose, and
            climb out at around 100 KIAS.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>The Extra isn't designed for long cross-country
            flights, but it will get you there at about 150 knots
            at typical cruise-power settings.</p>

            <p>Try using 24 inches of manifold pressure (use the
            joystick throttle, press <strong>F2</strong>, or drag the
            throttle control) and 2400 rpm (press <strong>CTRL+F2</strong>,
            or drag the prop control). You can fly for about two
            hours under most conditions and still have a safe fuel
            reserve.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Precise speed control is essential for smooth
            landings in the 300S. Plan to fly your final approach
            at 80 knots, keeping some power on. If you get much
            slower, the Extra will start to descend rapidly. Try to
            land any faster, and you'll float down the runway.</p>

            <p>As you enter the traffic pattern, bring the power
            back to about 15 inches of manifold pressure (use the
            joystick throttle, press <strong>F2</strong>, or drag the
            throttle control).</p>

            <p>Adjust the pitch attitude of the nose to hold
            airspeed at 70 knots. If you get a little low, add an
            inch or two of manifold pressure. If you think you're
            too high, reduce power by an inch or two.</p>

            <p>As you cross over the runway threshold, smoothly
            reduce power to idle, and hold the nose slightly above
            the horizon. Let the airplane settle gently onto the
            runway. Look outside using your peripheral vision to
            stay lined up until you exit the runway.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, bring the power back to idle, hold
            full back pressure on the stick (use the joystick or
            yoke, or press the <strong>DOWN ARROW</strong>), apply brakes
            (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key), and exit the runway.</p>
