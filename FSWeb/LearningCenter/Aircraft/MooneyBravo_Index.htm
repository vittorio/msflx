            <p><a href="FlightNotesMooneyBravo.htm">Flight
            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the Mooney Bravo</p>

            <p>Mooneys are built to go fast. A focus on speed seems
            natural for a company that at one time offered a plane
            powered by a Porsche engine. Although the partnership
            with the Germans didn't last, Mooney's commitment to
            speed certainly has. In keeping with this idea, Mooney
            has experimented with a number of "big engine" models.
            The Bravo is Mooney's fastest; with 270 horsepwer all
            the way to 25,000 feet, the Bravo can attain speeds up
            to 220 KTAS, making it the fastest single-engine
            airplane currently produced.</p>

            <p>In 1989, the M-20M TLS (Turbocharged Lycoming Sabre)
            was introduced. It married the fuselage of the
            Porsche-powered Mooney PFM to a turbocharged and
            intercooled Textron Lycoming TIO-540-AF1A six-cylinder
            engine. Capable of producing 350 horsepower (hp),
            Mooney limited the M-20M to 270 horsepower to provide a
            quieter cabin and longer time between engine overhauls.
            It also had a three-bladed prop, which added ground
            clearance. (Besides, pilots find three-bladed props
            sexy.)</p>

            <p>Electronically operated Precise Flight speed brakes
            became standard equipment on the TLS. With its high
            cruise speeds and high-altitude performance, the speed
            brakes were a welcome addition. Coming down from
            altitude, the pilot can leave the power at higher
            settings to avoid shock-cooling the engine and use the
            speed brakes to stay at the desired airspeed. Electric
            rudder trim was also added to compensate for the high
            torque forces with the big engine. Only minor
            engineering changes were incorporated into the plane
            from 1989 to 1996&#8212;testament to a solid initial
            design.</p>

            <p>In mid-1996, Mooney introduced a new version of the
            TLS. The most significant change in this model was an
            engine upgrade. Engineers decided that additional
            cooling lubrication was needed, so the airplane was
            fitted with the Lycoming TIO-540-AF1B. The engine's "B"
            designation gave the new Mooney its name: Bravo.</p>

            <p>Although turbocharging an engine adds cost and
            complexity, it gives the airplane more flexibility as a
            vehicle. You can get higher and go faster when the
            turbocharger is feeding the engine denser air than it
            would normally find at higher altitudes. And this is
            what the Bravo is all about; the ability to get above
            the bulk of the nasty weather and still achieve
            220-knot cruise speeds. At low to medium altitudes, the
            only thing that will outrun the Bravo is Mooney's own
            Ovation. Above 10,000 feet, the Bravo will outrun
            virtually any new production piston single or twin,
            even challenging such accepted twin-engine speed demons
            as the out-of-production Baron 58P and Aerostar
            601P.</p>

            <p>That's what defines this aircraft's appeal: it's
            about getting there fast. And in that department, the
            Bravo stands alone.</p>
