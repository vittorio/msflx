            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the Cessna 172 SP</p>
			
            <p>This isn't the aviation equivalent of some cheap
            date you'll be taking out for one wild, adventurous
            weekend. The Cessna 172 is more like the love of your
            life&#8212;a steady, constant companion to fly with for
            a long time to come. A stable and trustworthy plane,
            most pilots have logged at least a few hours in a
            Cessna 172, since it's the most widely available
            aircraft in the rental fleet and is used by most flight
            schools. Since the first prototype was completed in
            1955, more than 35,000 C172s have been produced, making
            it the world's most popular single-engine plane. One of
            Cessna's first tricycle-gear airplanes, the 172 quickly
            became the favorite of a growing class of business
            pilots. Its reliability and easy handling (along with
            thoughtful engineering and structural updates) have
            ensured its continued popularity for more than 35
            years.</p>

            <p>The differences between an original 1956 172 and
            today's version are many, but there are a few
            similarities. The wing has the same NACA 2412 airfoil
            that Cessna's been using since production of its 170,
            and the plane continues to use the same flat-plate
            ailerons that 172s and 152s have always been known for,
            making it a steady handler, if not exactly an exciting
            one.</p>

            <p>Updates to the 172 have been carefully chosen and
            consistently well made. The 172 received its
            distinctive swept-back tail in 1960 and its helpful
            wraparound rear window in 1962. In 1964, Cessna began
            using a 150-horsepower Lycoming engine rather than the
            old six-cylinder, air-cooled Continental engines of the
            original 172s. With the SP comes a further engine
            update providing an even higher maximum takeoff weight.
            With its fuel-injected, 180-horsepower Textron-Lycoming
            IO-360, the SP has 20 horsepower more than even a 172R
            and a maximum takeoff weight of 2,550 pounds-250 pounds
            more than the 172R.</p>

            <p>172s are famed for their stability. In the 1960s and
            '70s, Cessna vied for attention and respectability by
            attempting to build a hardworking airplane that could
            be easily flown by nearly anyone. With the 172, they
            undoubtedly succeeded. When properly trimmed, this
            airplane will fly itself for hours at a time, needing
            little to no physical guidance from the pilot. And like
            other Cessnas, 172s don't like stalling, either.</p>

            <p>Cessna temporarily stopped manufacturing the 172 in
            1986, when market forces and high product-liability
            premiums forced the company to implement serious
            cutbacks. Pilots around the world breathed a sigh of
            relief when, 10 years later, President Bill Clinton
            enacted the General Aviation Revitalization Act. Cessna
            celebrated the good news with the completion of a new
            plant in Independence, Kansas and immediately began
            production on a new version of the 172. If the new
            172SP is any indication, things have only gotten better
            since then.</p>
