            Notes</a>&#8211; how to fly the 737&#8211;800</p>

            <p>The Boeing 737 is the world's most popular jetliner, 
			and the 737-800 is one of the latest and most advanced models.
			 In service since 1967, the 737 became the best-selling 
			 commercial jetliner worldwide after twenty years when orders
			  for it reached 1,831. After almost another twenty years, 
			  orders for this long-lived family of aircraft are approaching
			   6,000 with, 5,000 delivered.</p>

            <p>The reason for the 737's great success is its design 
			flexibility. It has always lent itself well to modifications 
			that fit the market needs of its customers, and it has undergone
			 a remarkable evolution over the years. The length of the original
			  737-100 was only eight inches more than its wingspan, giving the
			   airplane a stubby look that led to its nickname, "Fat Albert." 
			   It could carry a maximum of 100 passengers, a suitable load at 
			   the time for Boeing's then-smallest jet airliner. Derivative 
			   models were already on the drawing board before the first 
			   737-100 ever flew. The -200 grew in length and was fitted 
			   with progressively more powerful engines. The -300 introduced 
			   a new type of engine that made far less noise and provided 
			   better fuel economy. The -400 was a stretched version tailored 
			   for charter and business airline applications.</p>

            <p>Since 1997, the Original (-100/-200) and Classic (-300/-400/-500)
			 variants of the 737 have been replaced on the production line by 
			 models in the Next-Generation series (-600/-700/-800/-900). Today 
			 the latest, stretched members of the 737 family (-800/-900) can 
			 carry up to 189 passengers, so the little Boeing jet has grown 
			 up to equal the capacity of its four-engined big brother, the 
			 venerable 707.</p>

            <p>With updated engines, wings, and avionics, the Next-Generation
			 737 models represent not just a stretch, but a major redesign of 
			 the original 737. Their new features-including distinctive 
			 advanced-technology winglets (which enhance fuel economy and 
			 performance during takeoff and climb-out, as well as range 
			 and payload) and a modern "glass cockpit"-carry the Boeing 737 
			 decisively into the twenty-first century.</p>
