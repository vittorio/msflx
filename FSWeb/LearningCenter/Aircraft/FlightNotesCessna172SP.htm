            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

                  <p>By default, this aircraft has full fuel and
                  payload. Depending on atmospheric conditions,
                  altitude. and other factors, you will not get the
                  same performance at gross weight that you would

            <p class="SubHead">Required Runway Length</p>

            <p>960 feet at sea level with ISA conditions.</p>

            <p>Note: The length required for both takeoff and
            landing is a result of a number of factors, including
            aircraft weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and
            ambient temperature. Lower weights and temperatures
            will result in better performance, as will having a
            headwind component. Higher altitudes and temperatures
            with degrade performance.</p><a name=
            "EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine will be running automatically every time
            you begin a flight. If you shut the engine down, you
            can initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If you want to do the startup procedures
            manually, use the checklist on the
            Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>While taxiing, the power should be set at
            approximately 1,000 rpm. (Mixture should be full
            forward.) As you move down the taxiway, use the rudder
            to turn the nose right and left for directional
            control. (Twist the joystick; use the rudder pedals; or
            press <strong>0</strong> or <strong>ENTER</strong> on the numeric keyboard
            to turn left or right, respectively.)</p><a name=
            "Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>For a normal takeoff, Cessna recommends 0 to 10
            degrees of flaps (at the pilot's discretion). Using 10
            degrees of flaps reduces the takeoff roll by
            approximately 10 percent.</p><a name="Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist, and set
            flaps at either 0 or 10 degrees (press <strong>F7</strong>, or
            click the flaps lever), depending on the runway
            situation.</p>

            <p>Align the aircraft with the white runway centerline,
            and advance the throttle control to full power (use the
            joystick throttle, or press <strong>F4</strong>).</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Climb with full throttle, no flaps, and a fully rich
            mixture&#8212;approximately 75 to 85 knots&#8212;when
            below 3,000 feet. Above 3,000 feet, lean the mixture
            for smooth operation and for maximum rpm.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section. However, a good rule to bear
            in mind is that an airplane with a normally aspirated
            engine is most efficient between 6,000-8,000 feet. That
            altitude range gives the best tradeoff between
            available power, fuel economy, and true airspeed.</p>

            <p>Ideal cruise settings for the 172SP are between 45
            and 75 percent power. When above 3,000 feet, lean the
            mixture for optimum performance. (For more information,
            see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/ControllingTheEngine.htm">Controlling
            the Engine</a>.)</p><a name="DescentandApproach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent and Approach</p>

            <p>Reduce power to 2,100 rpm, and set the airplane up
            for a descent rate of approximately 450 feet per
            minute.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>On final approach, plan for a landing speed of 65
            knots with full flaps. Select a point just past the
            runway threshold, and aim for it. Adjust your pitch so
            that the point remains stationary in your view out the
            windscreen. Leave the power at approximately 1,500 rpm,
            and fly the airplane down to the runway. Keep the nose
            off the ground, and slowly bring back the throttle
            completely while you flare just above the runway. Touch
            down with the back wheels first. With less than full
            flaps, expect a bit of float in the flare.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, apply brakes by pressing the
            <strong>PERIOD</strong> key. Exit the runway, and retract the
            wing flaps.</p>
