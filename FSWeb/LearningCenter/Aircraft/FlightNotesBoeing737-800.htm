            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day

            <p>The length required for both takeoff and landing is
            a result of a number of factors, such as aircraft
            weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and ambient

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engines are running by default when you begin a
            flight. If you shut the engines down, it is possible to
            initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong> on your keyboard.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Idle thrust is
            adequate for taxiing under most conditions, but you'll
            need a slightly higher thrust setting to get the
            aircraft rolling. Allow time for a response after each
            thrust change before changing the thrust setting
            again.</p>

            <p>Normal straight taxi speed should not exceed 20
            knots (10 knots in turns).</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, rudder pedals (twist the
            joystick, use the rudder pedals, or press <strong>0</strong>
            [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the numeric keypad)
            are used for directional control during taxiing. Avoid
            stopping the 737 during turns, as excessive thrust is
            required to get moving again.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>The following table lists recommended maneuvering
            speeds for various flap settings. The minimum
            flap-retraction altitude is 400 feet, but 1,000 feet
            complies with most noise abatement procedures. When
            extending or retracting the flaps, use the next
            appropriate flap setting depending on whether you're
            slowing down or speeding up.</p>
            <pre>
Flap Position
Flaps Up        210
Flaps 1         190
Flaps 5         170
Flaps 10        160
Flaps 30        130
Flaps 40        120
			</pre>

            <p>In adverse weather conditions, taxi with the wing
            flaps up and then set takeoff flaps during your Before
            Takeoff checklist procedure. Likewise, retract the
            flaps as soon as practicable upon landing.</p>

            <p>Flaps are generally not used on the 737&#8211;800
            for the purpose of increasing the descent rate during
            the descent or approach phases of flight. Normal
            descents are made in the clean configuration to pattern
            or Initial Approach Point (IAP) altitude.</p><a name=
            "Takeoff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>All of the following occurs quite rapidly. Read
            through the procedure several times before attempting
            it in the plane so you know what to expect.</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist and set
            flaps to 5 (press <strong>F7</strong>, or click the flap lever on
            the panel).</p>

            <p>With the aircraft aligned with the runway
            centerline, advance the throttles (press <strong>F3</strong>, or
            drag the throttle levers) to approximately 60 percent
            N1. This allows the engines to spool up to a point
            where uniform acceleration to takeoff thrust will occur
            on both engines. The exact amount of initial setting is
            not as important as setting symmetrical thrust.</p>

            <p>As the engines stabilize (this occurs quickly),
            advance the thrust levers to takeoff thrust&#8212;less
            than or equal to 100 percent N1. Final takeoff thrust
            should be set by the time the aircraft reaches 60 KIAS.
            Directional control is maintained by use of the rudder
            pedals (twist the joystick, use the rudder pedals, or
            press <strong>0</strong> [left] or <strong>ENTER</strong> [right] on the
            numeric keypad).</p>

            <p>Below about 80 KIAS, the momentum developed by the
            moving aircraft is not sufficient to cause difficulty
            in stopping the aircraft on the runway.</p>

            <p>V1, approximately 145 KIAS, is decision speed. Above
            this speed, it may not be possible to stop the aircraft
            on the runway in case of a rejected takeoff (RTO).</p>

            <p>At Vr, approximately 145 KIAS, smoothly pull the
            stick (or yoke) back to raise the nose to 8 degrees
            above the horizon. Hold this pitch attitude and be
            careful not to over-rotate (doing so before liftoff
            could cause a tail strike).</p>

            <p>At V2, approximately 150 to 155 KIAS, the aircraft
            has reached its takeoff safety speed. This is the
            minimum safe flying speed if an engine fails. Hold this
            speed until you get a positive rate of climb.</p>

            <p>As soon as the aircraft is showing a positive rate
            of climb on liftoff (both vertical speed and altitude
            are increasing), retract the landing gear (press
            <strong>G</strong>, or drag the landing gear lever). The aircraft
            will quickly accelerate to V2+10. A pitch attitude of 15-17
			 degrees nose up will maintain V2+10 or greater during the climb.</p>

            <p>At 1,000 ft (305 m), reduce flaps from 5 to 1 (press
            <strong>F6</strong>, or drag the flaps lever). Lower the pitch
			slightly and accelerate to 210 KIAS, at which point you can go to
            flaps up (press <strong>F6</strong> again).</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>As you retract the flaps, set climb power of
            approximately 90 percent N1 (press <strong>F2</strong>, use the
            throttle control on your joystick, or drag the thrust
            levers). Maintain 6 or 7 degrees nose-up pitch
            attitude to climb at 250 kts until reaching 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters), and then maintain 280 KIAS to your
            cruising altitude.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude is normally determined by winds,
            weather, and other factors. You might want to use these
            factors in your flight planning if you have created
            weather systems along your route. Optimum altitude is
            the altitude that gives the best fuel economy for a
            given configuration and gross weight. A complete
            discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond the scope
            of this section.</p>

            <p>When climbing or descending, take 10 percent of your
            rate of climb or descent and use that number as your
            target for the transition. For example, if you're
            climbing at 1500 fpm, start the transition 150 feet
            below the target altitude.</p>

            <p>You'll find it's much easier to operate the Boeing
            737&#8211;800 in climb, cruise, and descent if you use
            the autopilot. The autopilot can hold the altitude,
            speed, heading, or navaid course you specify. For more
            information on using the autopilot, see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingAnAutopilot.htm">Using an
            Autopilot</a>.</p>

            <p>Normal cruise speed is Mach 0.785 (at 35,000 feet). You can set .78 in
            the autopilot Mach hold window and engage the Hold
            button (click the <strong>Mach</strong> button). Set the A/T Arm
            (click the switch to engage the autothrottles), and the
            autothrottles will set power at the proper percent to
            maintain this cruise speed. The changeover from
            indicated airspeed to Mach number typically occurs as
            you climb to altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000
            to 9,000 meters).</p>

            <p>Remember that your true airspeed is actually much
            higher in the thin, cold air. You'll have to experiment
            with power settings to find the setting that maintains
            the cruise speed you want at the altitude you
            choose.</p><a name="Descent"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent</p>

            <p>A good descent profile includes knowing where to
            start down from cruise altitude and planning ahead for
            the approach. Normal descent is done with idle thrust
            and clean configuration (no speed brakes). A good rule
            for determining when to start your descent is the
            3-to-1 rule (three miles distance per thousand feet in
            altitude). Take your altitude in feet, drop the last
            three zeros, and multiply by 3.</p>

            <p>For example, to descend from a cruise altitude of
            35,000 feet (10,668 meters) to sea level:<br>
            35,000 minus the last three zeros is 35.<br>
            35 x 3=105</p>

            <p>This means you should begin your descent 105
            nautical miles from your destination, maintaining a
            speed of 250 KIAS (about 45 percent N1) and a descent
            rate of 1,500 to 2,000 feet per minute, with thrust set
            at idle. Add two extra miles for every 10 knots of
            tailwind.</p>

            <p>To descend, disengage the autopilot if you turned it
            on during cruise, or set the airspeed or vertical speed
            into the autopilot and let it do the flying for you.
            Reduce power to idle, and lower the nose slightly. The
            737&#8211;800 is sensitive to pitch, so ease the nose
            down just a degree or two. Remember not to exceed the
            regulation speed limit of 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet
            (3,048 meters). Continue this profile down to the
            beginning of the approach phase of flight.</p>

            <p>Deviations from this procedure can result in
            arriving too high at the destination (requiring
            circling to descend) or arriving too low and far out
            (requiring expenditure of extra time and fuel). Plan to
            have an initial approach fix regardless of whether or
            not you're flying an instrument approach.</p>

            <p>It takes about 35 seconds and 3 miles (5.5
            kilometers) to decelerate from 290 KIAS to 250 KIAS in
            level flight without speed brakes. It takes another 35
            seconds to slow to 210 KIAS. Plan to arrive at
            traffic-pattern altitude at the flaps-up maneuvering
            speed about 12 miles out when landing straight-in, or
            about eight miles out when entering a downwind
            approach. A good crosscheck is to be at 10,000 feet AGL
            (3,048 meters), 30 miles (55.5 kilometers) from the
            airport at 250 KIAS.</p><a name="Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Approach</p>


            <p>Have your aircraft configuration (flaps and
            landing gear) set and establish your target speed well ahead.
            Excess speed in the &#8211;800 will require a level
            flight segment to slow down.</p>

            <p>If you're high coming into the approach, you can use
            the speed brakes to increase descent. If possible,
            avoid using the speed brakes to increase descent when
            wing flaps are extended. Do not use speed brakes below
            1,000 feet AGL.</p>

            <p>On an instrument approach, you want to be configured
            for landing and establish approach speed by the final
            approach fix (where you intercept the glideslope),
            usually about five miles from touchdown.</p>

            <p>Set flaps to 1 (press <strong>F7</strong>, or drag the flaps
            indicator or lever) when airspeed is reduced below the
            minimum flaps-up maneuvering speed. Normally, this
            would be when entering the downwind leg or at the
            initial approach fix, so you should be at the desired
            airspeed by this point. You can then continue adding
            flaps as you get down to the speed limits for each
            setting.</p>

            <p>Flaps 30 or 40 is the setting for normal landings.</p>

            <p>Intercept the glideslope from below, and extend the
            landing gear (press G, or drag the landing gear lever)
            when the glideslope needle is less than or equal to one
            dot high.</p>

            <p>The proper final approach speed varies with weight,
            but a good target at typical operating weight is 140 KIAS.</p>

            <p>With landing gear down and flaps at 30 degrees, set
            the power to maintain 140. This configuration
            should hold airspeed with a good descent angle toward
            the runway. Use small power adjustments and pitch
            changes to stay on the glidepath. You're looking for a
            descent rate of about 700 fpm.</p>

            <p>Before landing, make sure the speed brake handle
            is in the ARM position.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Select a point about 1,000 feet (305 meters) past
            the runway threshold, and aim for it. Adjust your pitch
            so that the point remains stationary in your view out
            the windscreen.</p>

            <p>At 50 feet (15 meters) above the runway, reduce the 
			throttles to idle. As the threshold goes out of sight beneath you,
            shift the visual sighting point to about &#190; down
            the runway. At 30 feet (9 meters) above the runway, initiate a flare
            by raising the nose about 5 degrees and fly the airplane onto the
            runway.</p>

            <p>To assure adequate aft fuselage clearance on
            landing, fly the airplane onto the runway at the
            desired touchdown point. DO NOT hold the airplane off
            the runway for a soft landing.</p>

            <p>When the main gear touch, apply the brakes smoothly
            (press the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key, or press Button
            1&#8212;typically the trigger&#8212;on the
            joystick).</p>

            <p>If you armed the spoilers, they will deploy
            automatically. If not, move the brake lever into the UP
            position now. Add reverse thrust (press <strong>F2</strong>, or
            drag the thrust levers into reverse). Make sure you
            come out of reverse thrust when airspeed drops below 60
            knots.</p>

            <p>Once you're clear of the runway and as you taxi to
            the terminal, retract the flaps (press <strong>F5</strong>, or
            drag the flaps lever) and lower the spoilers (press the
            <strong>SLASH</strong> [ / ], or click the brake lever).</p>
