            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

                  <p><strong>Important:</strong> These instructions are
                  intended for use with Flight Simulator only and
                  are no substitute for using the actual aircraft
                  manual for real-world flight.</p>

                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> As with all of the Flight
                  Simulator aircraft, the V-speeds and checklists
                  are located on the Kneeboard. To access the
                  Kneeboard while flying, press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>, or
                  on the <strong>Aircraft</strong> menu, click
                  <strong>Kneeboard</strong>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> All speeds given in Flight Notes
                  are indicated airspeeds. If you're using these
                  speeds as reference, be sure that you select
                  "Display Indicated Airspeed" in the Realism
                  Settings dialog box. Speeds listed in the
                  specifications table are shown as true
                  airspeeds.</p>

                  <p>By default, this aircraft has full fuel and

                  altitude, and other factors, you will not get the
                  same performance at gross weight that you would
                  with a lighter load.</p>

            <p>2,200 feet with ISA conditions. 3,800 feet with a
            50-foot obstacle.</p>

            <p>Note: The length required for both takeoff and
            landing is a result of a number of factors, including
            aircraft weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and
            ambient temperature. Lower weights and temperatures
            will result in better performance, as will having a
            headwind component. Higher altitudes and temperatures
            will degrade performance.</p><a name=
            "EngineStartup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine will be running automatically every time
            you begin a flight. If you shut the engine down, you
            can initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If you want to do the startup procedures
            manually, use the checklist on the
            Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Set prop and mixture to full forward, and taxi at a

            <p class="SubHead">Takeoff</p>

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist found in
            the Kneeboard (press <strong>F10</strong>).</p>

            <p>Align the aircraft with the white runway centerline,
            and advance the throttle to takeoff power.</p><a name=
            "Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Climb at approximately 105 knots.</p><a name=
            "Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>However, as an example: At 11,500 feet, set your
            airspeed for 196 KTAS (true airspeed). Keep full power,
            around 2500 rpm.</p><a name="DescentandApproach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent and Approach</p>

            <p>Reduce airspeed to 170 knots when below 13,000
            feet.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>Reduce airspeed and adjust flaps as you descend. At
            152 knots, apply 15 degrees of flaps. Extend full flaps
            at 122 knots.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, bring the power back to idle and
            lightly apply the brakes by pressing the <strong>PERIOD</strong>
            key.</p>
