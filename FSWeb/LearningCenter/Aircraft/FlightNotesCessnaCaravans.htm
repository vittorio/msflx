            <p>Many factors affect flight planning and aircraft
            operation, including aircraft weight, weather, and
            runway surface. The recommended flight parameters
            listed below are intended to give approximations for
            flights at maximum takeoff or landing weight on a day
            with International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
            conditions.</p>

                  intended for use with Flight Simulator only and
                  are no substitute for using the actual aircraft
                  manual for real-world flight.</p>

                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> As with all of the Flight
                  Simulator aircraft, the V-speeds and checklists
                  are located on the Kneeboard. To access the
                  Kneeboard while flying, press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>, or
                  on the <strong>Aircraft</strong> menu, click

                  <p><strong>Note:</strong> All speeds given in Flight Notes
                  are indicated airspeeds. If you're using these
                  speeds as reference, be sure that you select
                  "Display Indicated Airspeed" in the Realism
                  Settings dialog box. Speeds listed in the
                  specifications table are shown as true

                  <p>By default, this aircraft has full fuel and
                  payload. Depending on atmospheric conditions,
                  altitude, and other factors, you will not get the
                  same performance at gross weight that you would
                  with a lighter load.</p>

            <p>2,500 feet (765 meters), with ISA conditions.</p>

            <p>Note: The length required for both takeoff and
            landing is a result of a number of factors, including
            aircraft weight, altitude, headwind, use of flaps, and
            ambient temperature. Lower weights and temperatures
            will result in better performance, as will having a
            headwind component. Higher altitudes and temperatures
            will degrade performance.</p><a name=
            "Engine Startup"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Engine Startup</p>

            <p>The engine will be running automatically every time
            you begin a flight. If you shut the engine down, you
            can initiate an auto-startup sequence by pressing
            <strong>CTRL+E</strong>. If you want to do the startup procedures
            manually, use the checklist on the
            Kneeboard.</p><a name="Taxiing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Taxiing</p>

            <p>Set prop and mixture should be full forward for
            taxiing. As you move down the taxiway, use the rudder
            to turn the nose right and left for directional
            control. (Twist the joystick; use the rudder pedals; or
            press <strong>0</strong> or <strong>ENTER</strong> on the numeric keyboard
            to turn left or right, respectively.)</p><a name=

            <p>Run through the Before Takeoff checklist found in
            the Kneeboard (<strong>F10</strong>). Set flaps (press <strong>F7</strong>,
            or click the flaps lever) between 0 and 20 degrees,
            depending on the runway situation.</p>

            <p>Align the aircraft with the white runway centerline,
            and advance the throttle to takeoff power (1900
            torque).</p><a name="Climb"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Climb</p>

            <p>Set climb speed for between 110 and 120
            KIAS.</p><a name="Cruise"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Cruise</p>

            <p>Cruise altitude would normally be determined by
            winds, weather, and other factors. You might want to
            use these factors in your flight planning if you have
            created weather systems along your route. Optimum
            altitude is the altitude that gives the best fuel
            economy for a given configuration and gross weight. A
            complete discussion about choosing altitudes is beyond
            the scope of this section.</p>

            <p>Set your airspeed for 155 KIAS. Set your propeller
            for 1600-1900 rpm by pressing <strong>CTRL+F2</strong> or
            <strong>CTRL+F3</strong>.</p><a name="Descent and Approach"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Descent and Approach</p>

            <p>Reduce airspeed to 75-85 KIAS with flaps fully down.
            Adjust flaps slowly in increments as follows: At 175
            KIAS, lower to 10 degrees. At 150 KIAS, lower to 20
            degrees. Finally, lower to 30 degrees at 125
            KIAS.</p><a name="Landing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing</p>

            <p>On final approach, plan for a landing speed of 75-85
            KIAS with full flaps. Plan to land slightly
            tail-low.</p>

            <p>Upon touchdown, bring the power back to idle, gently
            lower the nosewheel, and lightly apply the brakes by
            pressing the <strong>PERIOD</strong> key.</p>
