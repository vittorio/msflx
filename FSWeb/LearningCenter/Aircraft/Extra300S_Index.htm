            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the Extra 300S</p>

            <p>If airplanes were horses, the Extra 300S would be a
            champion thoroughbred. It is, in fact, designed to be a
            champion in Unlimited class aerobatic competitions. The
            300S combines light weight, a 300-horsepower engine,
            and exquisite control harmony in an aircraft that has
            won several World Aerobatic Championships.</p>

            <p>A derivative of the two-place model 300, the wing of
            the single-place 300S was lowered eight inches to
            provide better ground visibility and improve the
            general appearance of the aircraft. After this
            anxiously awaited model was introduced in March 1992,
            three of the four existing production aircraft were
            flown in the World Championship that July.</p>

            <p>The Extra 300S has an incredible roll-rate: 400
            degrees per second. Just as impressive is how precisely
            maneuvers can be executed in the hands of an expert
            pilot like Patty Wagstaff. Attend one of her airshows,
            and you'll see a 300S carve paths through the sky like
            it's on a rail. Most aircraft require the pilot to
            drive downhill a bit to gather enough inertia for a
            loop. With the Extra 300S, just pull the stick back in
            level flight at high cruise power, and it leaps through
            the vertical, headed for the opposite horizon. This
            airplane is at home in a roll, loop, tail slide,
            hammerhead, Cuban Eight, or any other extreme attitude
            you want to put it into.</p>

            <p>A hint of the control sensitivity of the 300S comes
            with the first movement of the stick. There is no slack
            or resistance in the control circuit. When you move the
            controls, the airplane follows instantly. Long ailerons
            provide the aerial equivalent of power-assisted
            rack-and-pinion steering, and fingertip control is all
            that's needed. Even at steep bank angles, the controls
            are surprisingly light. Electrically adjustable rudder
            pedals customize the plane's fit to any pilot, and the
            bubble canopy provides a roomy, panoramic view of the
            world whether right-side up or upside down.</p>

            <p>As with many taildragger aircraft, visibility over
            the nose of the 300S is not terrific when on the
            ground. The standard technique while taxiing is to
            perform S-turns to see where you're going. When you
            apply the power for the takeoff run, the tail comes up
            quickly, followed by the rest of the plane shortly
            thereafter.</p>

            <p>Most 300Ss are purchased by pilots who just want a
            fast, sporty plane that they can turn upside down on
            occasion. The rest go to buyers who employ them in
            competition or for entertaining the crowds at airshows.
            Whatever motivates them to buy it, owners of the Extra
            300S love this high-spirited and well-mannered stallion
            for its legendary performance.</p>
