            Notes</a>&#8212; how to fly the 208B Caravan.</p>

            <p>Wherever you want to go, the Cessna Caravan can get
            you there. First introduced by Cessna in 1985, the
            Caravan was designed to land nearly anywhere, on land
            or water. Undoubtedly, it has lived up to its creators'
            intentions. Whether supplies need to be brought to a
            flooded village in the mountains of Peru, an injured
            person needs to be flown out from a remote lake in
            Alaska, or an archaeologist wants access to a tiny site
            in the African desert, the Caravan has what's needed to
            do the job.</p>

            <p>In the initial design of the Caravan, Cessna took
            the fuselage of a Model 207 Stationair and enlarged it.
            However, it didn't take Cessna long to realize that in
            order to create a plane that provided enough cargo and
            fuel-carrying space, they'd have to start from close to
            scratch. They used sections of the 207 in the first
            prototype, but the ultimate design of the Caravan had
            no real predecessor.</p>

            <p>Caravans have large fuel tanks and tough, sturdy
            landing gear to ensure the aircraft's reliability on
            rough, unpaved airstrips. (And that landing gear can
            easily be replaced with floats in order to handle water
            landings.) Caravans also sport large wings for quick
            liftoffs on short, rough runways. One hundred and
            seventy-four square feet of wing area provide 335
            gallons of fuel capacity. The oil-only strut in the
            nose gear acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the
            engine from large loads placed onto it by the engine
            mounts as the airplane rolls over rocks and
            potholes.</p>

            <p>The first amphibious Caravan was certified in March
            1986 and was officially rolled out two months later. In
            the Amphibians, two large floats replace the landing
            gear. However, each float contains retractable landing
            gear, making the airplane truly amphibious. Each float
            can carry 200 pounds of gear inside watertight bulkhead
            compartments. The Amphibian also has retractable water
            rudders that provide maneuverability on the water and
            vertical fins on its horizontal stabilizer that balance
            the large float surface and provide more control.</p>

            <p>The first Caravans were made-to-order for Federal
            Express. FedEx has continued to depend on the Caravans'
            reliability, flexibility, and strength to provide
            hundreds of small communities around the world with
            access to overnight delivery service.</p>

            <p>As of 2005, more than 1500 Caravans worldwide log
            more than 71,000 hours per month&#8212;more than half a
            billion miles since the Caravan first took off.</p>As
            for the Amphibians, one of the earliest customers of
            the floating flyers was the Royal Canadian Mounted
            Police. These amphibious planes gave the RCMP access to
            miles of rivers and lakes throughout the provinces for
            both law enforcement and rescue missions.
