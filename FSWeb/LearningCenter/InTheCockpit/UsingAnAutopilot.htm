            <p class="SubHead">What is an Autopilot?</p>

            <p>An autopilot (from &quot;automatic pilot&quot;), is a device
            that can automatically control an aircraft's motion
            about one or more of its three axes (pitch, yaw, and
            roll), via input from a human pilot pushing buttons and
            turning knobs, or via navigational equipment sensing
            signals from navigation aids on the ground.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">What Can an Autopilot Do?</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, the Cessna aircraft and the
            Beechcraft Baron 58 are equipped with autopilots that
            can:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Hold the wings level so that the airplane does
              not turn.</li>

              <li>Maintain the aircraft's current pitch
              attitude.</li>

              <li>Maintain a selected heading.</li>

              <li>Maintain a selected altitude.</li>

              <li>Maintain a selected rate of climb or
              descent.</li>

              <li>Follow a VOR radial.</li>

              <li>Track a localizer or localizer back course.</li>

              Instrument Landing System (ILS).</li>

            Bombardier Learjet 45, and all of the Boeing jets in
            Flight Simulator are equipped with automatic flight
            control systems that include an autopilot, an
            autothrottle (jets only), and a flight director. These
            systems can:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Maintain a selected speed (indicated air speed or
              Mach number).</li>

              <li>Eliminate unwanted aircraft yaw.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">Why Would I Want to Use an
            Autopilot?</p>

            <p>There are some pilots who view using an autopilot as
            a crutch (as in, &quot;Real pilots don't need autopilots!&quot;),
            but they're missing out, because used properly an
            autopilot can substantially reduce your
            workload&#8230;especially when flying under Instrument
            Flight Rules (IFR). You can let the autopilot handle
            some of the grunt work (like maintaining heading and
            altitude) while you concentrate on more safety-oriented
            concerns (like navigating, looking for traffic, and
            communicating).</p>

            <p>Reducing your workload by using an autopilot will
            also help you feel less tired at the end of a long
            flight. There's nothing more dangerous during the
            approach and landing phases of a flight (especially a
            bumpy IFR flight in the clouds) than a pilot who's
            mentally and physically exhausted from simply flying
            the airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Two Most Important Rules</p>

            <p>When two pilots (for example, a flight instructor
            and a student) are taking turns controlling an
            airplane, they make it very clear who has control at
            any given moment. When one pilot hands over control to
            the other, he says, &quot;You have the airplane.&quot; As the
            second pilot takes control, he may respond, &quot;I have the
            airplane.&quot; In this way, they avoid a dangerous
            situation where both pilots are controlling the
            airplane (or no pilots are controlling the
            airplane).</p>

            <p>Using an autopilot is no different. The two most
            important rules to remember when using a two- or
            three-axis autopilot like the ones modeled in the
            Flight Simulator aircraft are:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>When the autopilot is off, you control the
              airplane.</li>

              <li>When the autopilot is on, the autopilot controls
              the airplane, and you monitor and control the
              autopilot.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="SubHead">Staying in the Loop</p>

            <p>Never ask the autopilot to do something you can't
            (or wouldn't) do yourself. For example, no good pilot
            would be able to make a 120-degree turn and intercept a
            localizer while flying at 300 knots less than a mile
            from the localizer; neither would an autopilot. Keep
            your expectations realistic. If you make things easy
            for the autopilot, the autopilot will make things easy
            for you.</p>

            <p>That said, just because the autopilot is on doesn't
            mean you should take a nap. The great thing about using
            an autopilot is that it frees up some of your attention
            to do other important tasks. So instead of staring
            blankly out the window, get to work:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Maintain situational awareness. Even when the
              autopilot is controlling the aircraft, as the pilot
              in command, you're still ultimately responsible.
              Don't rely on the autopilot to take you to your
              destination. If you know where you are at all times
              and the autopilot fails, you can easily take
              over.</li>

              <li>Monitor which autopilot functions are engaged.
              Talk to yourself, if it helps. For example, you might
              say, &quot;The autopilot is engaged. Altitude hold mode is
              engaged and we're climbing to 7,000 feet MSL. Heading
              hold is engaged and holding heading 260 degrees,
              which is our ATC-assigned heading to intercept the
              290 degree course from the Seattle VOR.&quot;</li>

              <li>Make sure the autopilot is doing what you want it
              to. If something seems wrong, if the autopilot seems
              to be malfunctioning, don't hesitate to disengage it:
              click the autopilot master switch, or press <strong>Z</strong>.
              Note that doing so does not disengage the
              autothrottle (available on Flight Simulator jets),
              which is a separate system. To disengage the
              <strong>autothrottle</strong>, click the autothrottle switch
              (see below), or press <strong>SHIFT+R</strong>).</li>

              <li>Monitor the engine instruments. Use some of your
              extra attention to check on the engine. Confirm
              desired power settings, and check on fuel usage.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">Other Tips</p>

            <p>There's a lot to remember about using autopilots.
            Here are some key points to keep in mind as you
            fly:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Don't attempt to manually control the aircraft
              with the joystick while the autopilot is turned on.
              If, for example, you select Altitude Hold mode and
              then try to hand-fly the airplane, the autopilot will
              compensate by running the trim. This situation can
              lead to several problems in the real world,
              especially if you're flying in the clouds. For
              example, upon disengaging the autopilot, you could
              find that the autopilot had run the trim all the way
              nose up or nose down and have a very hard time
              maintaining control of the airplane, or the autopilot
              could disengage itself after hitting the trim limits.
              You might assume that the autopilot is still on,
              release the controls to unfold a chart, or tune the
              radios, and enter a spiral, stall, or other
              unpleasant condition before you figured out what was
              going on.</li>

              <li>Always disengage the autopilot before landing.
              None of the autopilots in Flight Simulator are
              equipped with autoland capabilities. Always disengage
              the autopilot and autothrottles during the final
              approach, at least by decision height (DH).</li>

              <li>Always &quot;fly the airplane&quot; first and foremost. If
              you're fiddling with the autopilot and something
              doesn't make sense, don't fixate on the problem. Fly
              the airplane (manually if necessary), and come back
              to the problem as your time and attention
              permit.</li>

              <li>Don't lose your manual flying skills. Autopilots
              make your job easier, but if you always use one, you
              may forget how to fly by hand. Hand-fly every now and
              then to keep your skills sharp.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">Autopilot Controls</p>

            <p>The autopilot appears slightly different on each
            aircraft. On many aircraft, it's part of the radio
            stack. To display the radio stack, click the Radio icon
            <img src="images/UsingAnAutopilotRadioIcon.jpg" width=
            "20" height="19" alt="" border="0"> on the panel. On
            other Flight Simulator aircraft (typically jets), the
            autopilot is on part of the main instrument panel
            called the &quot;Mode Control Panel.&quot;</p>

            <p>You can change the autopilot's settings using the
            mouse: Just click a button to &quot;press&quot; it. You can also
            use the mouse to change the selected heading, course,
            altitude, and other settings. Hold the hand pointer
            over the numbers you want to change, wait until the
            hand shows a plus or minus sign, then click to make the
            change (or rotate the mouse wheel, if your mouse has
            one).</p>

            aircraft using your joystick or the keyboard. This is
            consistent with the functionality of real-world
            autopilots. As noted above, either the autopilot is
            controlling the aircraft, or the pilot is.</p>

            <p>When the autopilot is engaged, it controls both
            pitch and roll, and an associated flight director (not
            available on all airplanes) displays both pitch and
            roll commands. The autopilot cannot control just pitch
            or just roll, nor can the flight director display just
            pitch or just roll commands.</p>

            <p>If any autopilot mode buttons (for example, Heading
            mode, Altitude mode, or Navigation mode) are engaged
            when the autopilot master switch is turned on, the
            autopilot immediately maneuvers the aircraft to turn to
            that heading, climb/descend to that altitude, or
            intercept that course. For this reason, it's good
            practice to verify that the heading bug, altitude
            select, and course select are properly set before
            engaging the autopilot.</p>

            <p>In addition to an autopilot, the Learjet 45 and
            Boeing jets in Flight Simulator are each equipped with
            an auothrottle that can control airspeed by
            automatically adjusting the throttles. The autothrottle
            works independently from the autopilot, although most
            autothrottle controls are presented on the MCP along
            with the autopilot controls:</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">14 - Autothrottle arm switch</p>

            <p>The autothrottle arm switch arms the autothrottle.
            When armed, the autopilot controls the aircraft's
            throttles to hold a specific airspeed or Mach number
            (see below).</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Using the Flight Director</p>

            <p>A flight director helps you manually do what the
            autopilot would do if it were engaged: hold altitude,
            hold heading, track a VOR course, complete an ILS
            approach, and so forth.</p>

            <p>The flight director consists of either:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A pink chevron (on the King Air 350 and Learjet
              45) that displays on the Primary Flight Display. The
              chevron indicates deviation from the suggested
              heading and pitch attitude. Move the yoke to keep the
              yellow chevron (which indicates the aircraft) nestled
              just under the pink chevron (the flight
              director).<br>
              <img src="images/UsingAnAutopilot04.jpg" width="173"
              height="84" alt="" border="0"></li>

              <li>Two command bars (on the Boeing jets) that
              display on the Primary Flight Display. The vertical
              bar shows horizontal deviation from the suggested
              heading, the horizontal bar shows vertical deviation
              from the suggested pitch attitude. Move the yoke to
              keep the command bars centered.<br>
              <img src="images/UsingAnAutopilot05.jpg" width="108"
              height="78" alt="" border="0"></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whereas an altimeter or a VOR display shows raw data
            (you need to figure out what to do with the
            information), a flight director displays computed data
            (it tells you what to do). This makes your job much
            easier.</p>

            <p>With the flight director turned on and autopilot
            modes selected&#8212;but the autopilot master switch
            turned off&#8212;the flight director shows what the
            autopilot would do were it engaged, based on the
            setting of its modes. When both the flight director
            switch and the autopilot master switch are turned on,
            the flight director shows what the autopilot is
            doing.</p>

            <p>The flight director has just one control:</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">19 - Flight director switch</p>

            <p>The flight director switch turns the flight director
            on and off. Manipulate the yoke to follow the pink
            chevron, or to keep the command bars centered.</p>
