            <p>The radios in Flight Simulator are used to
            communicate with air traffic control. Occasionally you
            must tune the radios to new frequencies as you pass
            through various controllers' areas of
            responsibility.</p>

            <p>There are two ways to tune the radios: by using the
            Autotune feature and by tuning manually. To learn about
            interacting with ATC, see <a href=
            "../AirTrafficControl/ATCIndex.htm">Air Traffic
            Control</a>.</p>



            <p class="SubHead">Using Autotune</p>

            <p>Switching radio frequencies is easy if you use the
            Autotune feature because the switching is done for you
            automatically. This frees you to concentrate on flying
            the aircraft and navigating to your destination. When
            you select an ATC menu item that contacts a new
            controller (for example Contact Approach), the radio
            frequency changes to the new controller's frequency
            automatically.</p>

            <p>When using Autotune, you may not hear anything on
            the radio until you choose an item from the ATC menu,
            even if there are other aircraft talking to ATC (unless
            you're already tuned to an active frequency). That's
            because the radio is not tuned until you initiate
            contact by choosing a message from the menu.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Tuning the Radios Manually</p>

            <p>Pilots who want to do it all can bypass the Autotune
            feature by tuning the radios by hand. This means you'll
            have to tune the radios manually each time a frequency
            change is required.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/UsingTheRadios01.jpg" width="183" height=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>New menu items appear in the ATC window when you
            tune the radio to a new frequency. If you want to see
            choices for messages to a tower controller, for
            example, you must first tune the radio to the tower
            frequency.</p>

            <p>Use the audio panel's <strong>Com 1</strong>, <strong>Com 2</strong>, or
            <strong>Both</strong> buttons to choose which radios you want to
            transmit on and listen to. To choose a radio to
            Autotune, transmit, and receive on, click either the
            <strong>Com 1</strong> or <strong>Com 2</strong> button on the <strong>Audio</strong>
            panel. If you click the <strong>Both</strong> button, you will
            still be transmitting on the radio you had previously
            selected, but listening to both radios. This can be
            especially helpful on approach, since you don't want to
            tune away from the controller in order to hear ATIS (if
            you do, you'll miss traffic calls). You can also listen
            to the audio identifiers for the nav radios by
            selecting their buttons on the audio panel as well. If
            you have controllers tuned in on both radios, and the
            Both button is lit on the audio panel, it will sound
            very busy and perhaps be difficult to understand.</p>
