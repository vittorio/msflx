            <p>Engines can be humbling because they are reminders
            that humans really can't fly&#8212;at least not for
            long&#8212;without some help. So, you've got to be good
            to your aircraft's engine. Here are some operating tips
            that will help keep your aircraft's engine running
            strong.</p>

            <p>Many gauges on the control panel monitor engine
            functions. Two important engine instruments that
            measure engine power are the tachometer (which
            indicates engine speed as measured in revolutions per
            minute, or rpm), and the manifold pressure gauge (which
            indicates the pressure of air moving into the
            cylinders).</p><a name="UsingtheEngineControls"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Using the Engine Controls</p>

            <p><img src="images/ControllingtheEngine01.jpg" width=
            "197" height="85" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Most modern piston engine aircraft have two or three
            engine controls. Piston aircraft with a fixed-pitch
            propeller have two basic engine controls: a black
            throttle control&#8212;which has the most direct effect
            on power&#8212;and a red mixture control to adjust the
            air/fuel mixture as the airplane climbs and descends.
            Aircraft with a constant-speed propeller also have a
            blue propeller control to adjust the propeller's
            rotation speed.</p><a name="ThrottleControl"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Throttle Control</p>

            <p>The throttle determines how much power the engine
            can develop by controlling the amount of fuel and air
            entering the engine cylinders. When fully open, the
            throttle allows the maximum amount of fuel and air to
            enter the system to produce maximum power. When the
            throttle is closed, only a small amount of fuel and air
            can enter the system, and the engine produces minimum
            power. To open the throttle, push the throttle control
            in. To close the throttle, pull the control out. The
            manifold pressure gauge on the instrument panel shows
            the pressure of the air moving into the engine's
            cylinders, and gives an approximate measurement of
            engine power. Generally speaking, the higher the
            manifold pressure, the more power you have
            available.</p><a name="MixtureControl"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Mixture Control</p>

            <p>Because an aircraft's engine operates over a wide
            range of altitudes, the fuel/air mixture can be
            adjusted for maximum efficiency as you climb into
            thinner air or descend into denser air. A mixture that
            is too rich contains too much fuel for the existing
            atmospheric conditions and may cause the engine to run
            rough and lose power. The solution is to &quot;lean the
            mixture:&quot; As you climb, make the mixture leaner by
            pulling the mixture control back until the needle on
            the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge peaks, then
            push the mixture control forward a little. Don't lean
            the mixture too much, though: a mixture that is too
            lean can cause the engine to overheat or result in a
            problem known as detonation, a sudden, strong,
            uncontrolled, and often damaging explosion of fuel and
            air within the cylinder.</p><a name=
            "PropellerControl"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Propeller Control and Managing
            Power</p>

            <p>Piston engines are typically connected to a
            fixed-pitch or a constant-speed propeller.</p><a name=
            "FixedPitchPropellers"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Fixed-Pitch Propellers</p>

            <p>Fixed-pitch propellers are bolted directly to the
            crankshaft of the engine and therefore always turn at
            the same speed as the engine. A fixed-pitch prop is
            somewhat like a transmission with only one gear. This
            configuration makes up for its lack of efficiency by
            being very simple to operate. The only gauge that you
            need to monitor is the tachometer. Because the
            fixed-pitch propeller turns as fast as the engine, the
            engine's rpm is the best indicator of engine power. Use
            the tachometer to set your power during takeoff,
            cruising, and landing&#8212;the higher the rpm, the
            more power your engine is producing.</p>

            <p>With a fixed-pitch propeller, managing power is
            simple. Push the throttle in, and rpm (and power)
            increases. Pull the throttle out, and rpm decreases. Be
            aware, however, that as airspeed increases, rpm tends
            to creep up, too. Monitor the tachometer carefully
            during descents at high speed to make sure that the rpm
            stays within limits.</p><a name=
            "ConstantSpeedPropellers"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Constant-Speed Propellers</p>

            <p>A constant-speed propeller has a governor that
            adjusts the angle of the blades to maintain the rpm you
            select. This type of propeller makes much more
            efficient use of the engine's power. Adjusting the
            propeller in an airplane is very similar to using gears
            in a car. In low gears the engine turns fast to get you
            moving. Once you're underway, there's no need to use a
            lot of power, so you shift to a higher gear to make
            more efficient use of less power. In an airplane, the
            propeller control changes the angle at which the
            propeller blades meet the air, which affects how fast
            the engine turns. The tachometer on the instrument
            panel shows how fast your engine is turning.</p>

            <p>During takeoff and during landing (in case you need
            to abort and take off again) you'll need every bit of
            power your engine can develop. So during these two
            phases of flight, keep the propeller control pushed in:
            the angle of the blades will be low, slicing through
            the air easily so you can get the engine's full power
            (like using a low gear in a car). During cruise, pull
            the propeller control out a bit: the angle of the
            blades will increase and take a bigger bite out of the
            air, making more efficient use of the engine's power
            (like using a high gear in a car). Any time you change
            the throttle setting a governor will automatically
            adjust the angle of the blades to maintain the
            propeller speed.</p>

            <p>A constant-speed propeller makes power management a
            bit more complicated. You must monitor the manifold
            pressure gauge, controlled by the throttle, and the
            tachometer, which shows the propeller rpm. You adjust
            rpm with the prop control.</p>

            <p>When using the throttle and prop controls, remember
            these basic rules to avoid overstressing the
            engine:</p>
