            <p>Airplanes have evolved from relatively simple to
            incredibly complex machines. But remember: Whether
            you're flying a Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172 or a Boeing
            777&#8211;300, you're still flying an airplane, and
            airplanes are more alike than not. In the cockpit, for
            instance, most modern airplanes share six basic cockpit
            instruments: airspeed indicator, altimeter, attitude
            indicator, heading indicator (directional gyro), turn
            coordinator, and vertical speed indicator. Learning to
            use these six instruments and a few common controls,
            such as trim and flaps, will put you far down the
            runway toward flying any aircraft you wish.</p><a name=
            "PitotStaticInstruments"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Pitot Static Instruments</p>

            <p>Three of the six primary flight instruments measure
            air pressure. These instruments&#8212;the altimeter,
            airspeed indicator, and vertical speed
            indicator&#8212;are called the pitot static
            instruments.</p>

            <p>All three pitot static instruments are connected to
            a static port called the pitot tube. This port, or
            intake, introduces outside air into the case of each
            instrument. As an airplane climbs or descends, air
            pressure decreases or increases. The altimeter and
            vertical speed indicator display these pressure changes
            as altitude and rate of climb or descent.</p>

            <p>The airspeed indicator, which is also connected to
            the pitot tube, measures the difference between static
            pressure and ram air pressure. Ram air pressure is the
            air pressure created when outside air enters the pitot
            tube. As the airplane flies faster, outside air is
            forced into the pitot tube more rapidly, increasing the
            ram air pressure. The airspeed indicator displays the
            pressure difference between static pressure and ram
            pressure as airspeed, usually in knots or Mach
            number.</p><a name="GyroscopicInstruments"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Gyroscopic Instruments</p>

            <p>Three of the six primary flight instruments use
            gyroscopes to provide pilots with critical flight
            information about the airplane's attitude, heading, and
            rate of turn.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Rigidity in Space and
            Precession</p>

            <p>Gyroscopes work like spinning tops. They have two
            properties&#8212;rigidity in space and
            precession&#8212;that make them useful in flight
            instruments. See sidebar: <a href=
            "#GyroscopicProperties">Gyroscopic
            Properties</a>.</p>

            <p>The attitude indicator and heading indicator are
            based on a gyro's rigidity in space. Because a gyro
            resists being tipped over, it can provide a stable
            reference to the real horizon or to a specific
            direction.</p>

            <p>The turn coordinator uses precession to display
            information about the direction and rate of turn. (For
            more information on precession, see the <strong>Gyroscopic
            Properties</strong> sidebar.)</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Gyro Power</p>

            <p>In most light airplanes, an engine-driven vacuum
            pump spins the gyros in the attitude indicator and the
            heading indicator. To provide a backup if the vacuum
            fails, the turn coordinator usually has a gyro spun by
            an electric motor.</p><a name=

                  <p>What does a child's spinning top have to do
                  with flying an airplane? More than you might

                  <p>Remember how, when you were a kid, you'd spin
                  a top and it would stand upright for almost as
                  long as it had motion. You probably didn't know
                  it then, but it was exhibiting a property common
                  to all spinning discs, a property engineers call
                  rigidity in space. As the name implies, the disc
                  wants to remain as it is.</p>

                  <p>A gyroscope, or gyro, is a spinning disc whose
                  axis is mounted in a frame that allows it to move
                  freely in several directions. Just like your top,
                  it wants to remain as it is. You'll see that some
                  of the instruments in your Cessna Skyhawk SP
                  Model 172 use gyroscopes that also work on the
                  principle of rigidity in space.</p>

                    <li><em>Precession</em></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Precession is another property of a spinning
                  disc. If you push on the axis of your top, it
                  resists the push and the force actually moves in
                  a direction 90 degrees from where you're pushing.
                  In the same way, when you pitch your Skyhawk SP's
                  nose down, it wants to go left (or 90 degrees
                  from where the force is applied to the disc)
                  because of the propeller's gyroscopic effect.
                  Both are examples of gyroscopic precession.</p>

                  <p>Precession, by the way, is what lets you turn
                  your bicycle by leaning in the direction you want
                  to go when you're riding with no hands.
                  Precession is predictable and you have a
                  gyroscopic instrument in your Skyhawk SP that
                  uses the principle.</p>

                  <p>When it's used intentionally, precession can
                  work to your advantage. But it can also work
                  against you. Because of friction in bearings and
                  other reasons, precession sometimes shows up
                  where it's not wanted&#8212;for instance, when it
                  causes gyros to drift, instead of remaining rigid
                  in space. In this case, airplane designers offer
                  a couple of choices: they either build in a
                  correction for it over time, or they provide the
                  pilot a means to adjust the gyro.</p>

            <p>The airspeed indicator is a differential pressure
            gauge. It measures the difference between the air
            pressure in the pitot tube and the static, relatively
            undisturbed air surrounding the airplane. A needle
            displays this difference as airspeed.</p>

            <p>Aircraft manufactured in the United States after
            1976 have airspeed indicators with markings based on
            indicated airspeed in knots. Older aircraft typically
            have markings that reflect indicated airspeed in
            statute miles per hour.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How the Airspeed Indicator
            Works</p>

            <p>The airspeed indicator is the only instrument
            connected to both the pitot tube and the static system.
            Air from the static system fills the case of the
            airspeed indicator, providing a &quot;base&quot; pressure against
            an expandable diaphragm. Air forced into the pitot tube
            as the airplane moves fills the diaphragm, which
            expands as ram air pressure (and speed) increase. A
            needle connected to the diaphragm rotates as the
            diaphragm expands. The needle's position on the
            instrument face indicates airspeed.</p>

            <p>The airspeed indicators for the Bombardier Learjet
            45 and Boeing 737&#8211;400 include an additional
            needle with red and white stripes known as the &quot;barber
            pole.&quot; A flight data computer takes information about
            the current altitude, air temperature, and pressure and
            continuously computes the maximum allowable airspeed as
            the aircraft climbs and descends. The barber pole shows
            this speed.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The speeds used in Flight Simulator
            checklists, operating procedures, and in the <a href=
            "../Aircraft/AircraftInformationIndex.htm">Aircraft
            Information</a> articles are all indicated airspeeds,
            unless otherwise noted.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To create a realistic flying experience,
            Flight Simulator displays indicated airspeed by
            default. As your aircraft climbs, indicated airspeed
            decreases while true airspeed increases. The higher you
            climb, the greater the difference between IAS and TAS.
            To display true airspeed, choose <strong>Preferences</strong>
            from the <strong>Options</strong> menu and select the <strong>Display
            True Airspeed</strong> option on the <strong>Instrument</strong> tab
            of the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog box.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Altimeter</p>

            <p>The altimeter is a sensitive barometer that measures
            air pressure. It's calibrated to display that air
            pressure as height, usually in feet above mean sea
            level (MSL).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How the Altimeter Works</p>

            <p>The altimeter is connected to the static ports. The
            air pressure inside the instrument case decreases as
            the airplane climbs and increases as it descends. As
            the pressure in the case drops, sealed wafers in the
            instrument case expand. Increasing pressure squeezes
            the wafers. As the wafers expand and contract, needles
            connected to them rotate around the altimeter dial like
            hands on a watch.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Reading the Altimeter</p>

            <p>Most small aircraft are equipped with two-needle
            altimeters. The long needle shows hundreds of feet. The
            short needle points to thousands of feet. A
            wedge-shaped striped indicator appears whenever the
            current altitude is less than 10,000 feet (3,048
            meters). For example, if the long needle is on 5 and
            the short needle is between the 2 and 3, you're at
            2,500 feet (762 meters) MSL. If the striped indicator
            isn't visible, the same needle orientation shows that
            you're at 12,500 feet (3,810 meters) MSL.</p>

            <p>Jets and other high-performance aircraft typically
            have &quot;needle and drum&quot; altimeters. A long needle shows
            hundreds of feet and an odometer-like display shows
            altitude in numerical form.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Setting the Altimeter</p>

            <p>To display altitude accurately, the altimeter must
            be set to the current barometric pressure adjusted to
            sea-level pressure. This setting appears in the
            Kohlsman window&#8212;the scale between the <strong>2</strong>
            and <strong>3</strong> on the dial in the Skyhawk SP. Before
            takeoff, the pilot turns a setting knob to set the
            correct pressure. When properly set, the altimeter
            indicates the airport elevation&#8212;not
            zero&#8212;before the airplane takes off.</p>

            <p>Pilots can get the current altimeter setting from
            ATIS broadcasts, air traffic controllers, and Flight
            Service Stations (FSS). If one of these sources isn't
            available, the pilot should set the altimeter so that
            it displays the elevation of the departure airport.
            Pilots should also receive a current altimeter setting
            en route and for their destination airport.</p><a name=
            "TypesofAltitude"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Types of Altitude</p>

            <p>The altimeter in an airplane is designed to show
            height above sea level (MSL). The instrument is
            calibrated to show that height under standard
            atmospheric conditions. The current temperature and
            pressure rarely match standard conditions, however, so
            pilots must understand several types of altitude and
            know how to correct for altimeter errors caused by
            nonstandard conditions.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Indicated altitude</strong> is the altitude shown
              on the altimeter. If the altimeter is set to the
              current atmospheric pressure corrected to sea level,
              indicated altitude is approximately equal to the
              aircraft's height above sea level (MSL).</li>

              <li><strong>Pressure altitude</strong> is the altitude shown on
              the altimeter when the pressure is set to 29.92
              inches of mercury (or 1012.2 millibars). Pressure
              altitude is important in calculating density
              altitude, a critical factor in determining aircraft
              performance, true airspeed, and true altitude. In the
              United States, aircraft fly at pressure altitudes or
              &quot;flight levels&quot; when operating at or above 18,000
              feet MSL (5,486 meters). That's why you must set the
              altimeter to 29.92 whenever you fly at or above that
              altitude.</li>

              <li><strong>Density altitude</strong> is pressure altitude
              corrected for deviations from standard temperature.
              You must calculate density altitude to determine how
              much runway your airplane will need to take off and
              land, and its rate of climb. Calculating density
              altitude is especially important on a hot day when
              you're operating from an airport with an elevation
              well above sea level.</li>

              <li><strong>True altitude</strong> is your actual height above
              sea level. If you set the altimeter to local pressure
              corrected to sea level, indicated altitude is
              approximately true altitude.</li>

              <li><strong>Absolute altitude</strong> is your height at any
              instant above the terrain. Unless your aircraft is
              equipped with a radio or radar altimeter, you must
              estimate absolute altitude by comparing your
              indicated altitude with the terrain elevations shown
              on charts.</li>

              <li><strong>Radio (or radar) altitude</strong> is the absolute
              altitude displayed by radio or radar altimeters in
              large aircraft. Pilots use radio or radar altitude
              during the final phases of approach and landing,
              particularly when the ceiling and visibility are low,
              to help them determine decision height.</li>
            </ul><a name="AltimeterErrors"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Altimeter Errors</p>

            <p>The altimeter is calibrated to display the correct
            height above mean sea level when the temperature and
            pressure of the atmosphere match standard
            conditions.</p>

            <p>Variations in temperature usually don't cause
            significant errors, but if atmospheric pressure doesn't
            change at the standard rate, the altimeter won't
            display the correct altitude unless the pilot
            periodically adjusts the altimeter setting to the local
            atmospheric pressure (corrected to sea level). In fact,
            FAA regulations require you to use the proper altimeter
            setting as you fly (see FAR 91.121).</p>

            <p>For example, suppose the altimeter is set to 30.10
            inches before takeoff. If the airplane travels to an
            airport surrounded by a low-pressure system and the
            pilot does not change the altimeter setting, the
            altimeter senses the lower pressure as higher altitude.
            In other words, the altimeter shows an altitude higher
            than the airplane's actual height above sea level.</p>

            <p>Although the pilot thinks the airplane is at the
            correct altitude, it may be in conflict with other
            aircraft in the area whose pilots are using the correct
            local altimeter setting.</p>

            atmospheric pressure, press <strong>B</strong>.</p><a name=
            "AttitudeIndicator"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Attitude Indicator</p>

            <p><img src="images/CockpitBasics03.jpg" width="116"
            height="116" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>Sometimes called the &quot;artificial horizon,&quot; the
            attitude indicator is the only instrument that
            simultaneously displays both pitch and bank
            information.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How the Attitude Indicator
            Works</p>

            <p>The gyro mounted in the attitude indicator rotates
            in the horizontal plane and maintains its orientation
            relative to the real horizon as the airplane banks,
            climbs, and descends.</p>

            <p>Note, however, that the attitude indicator alone
            can't tell you whether the airplane is maintaining
            level flight, climbing, or descending. It simply shows
            the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon. To
            determine your flight path, you must crosscheck the
            airspeed indicator, altimeter, heading indicator, and
            other instruments.</p>

            <p>The pointer at the top of the attitude indicator
            moves along a scale with marks at 10, 20, 30, 60, and
            90 degrees of bank. The horizontal lines show the
            aircraft's pitch attitude in degrees above or below the
            horizon. The converging white lines in the bottom
            section of the indicator can also help you establish
            specific bank angles.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Limitations</p>

            <p>The gyros in the attitude indicators used in most
            small aircraft tumble if the pitch attitude exceeds
            +/-70 degrees or if the angle of bank exceeds 100
            degrees. When the gyro tumbles, it gives unreliable
            indications until it realigns itself, a process that
            usually requires several minutes of straight and level
            flight. Aerobatic planes and large aircraft are often
            equipped with gyros that are reliable through 360
            degrees of pitch and bank.</p>

            <p>Many modern attitude indicators have a blue &quot;sky&quot;
            and brown &quot;earth,&quot; which is the origin of the phrase
            &quot;keep the blue side up.&quot;</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Heading Indicator</p>

            <p>The heading indicator, sometimes called the
            &quot;directional gyro&quot; or &quot;DG,&quot; is one of the three
            gyroscopic instruments. When aligned with the compass,
            it provides an accurate, stable indication of the
            aircraft's magnetic heading. It should be emphasized
            that without a compass, the heading indicator is
            useless because it &quot;knows&quot; nothing about the magnetic
            heading. Only a magnetic compass can read earth's
            magnetic field. For more information on reading a
            magnetic compass, see <a href=
            "../Navigation/OldFashionedNavigation.htm">Old-Fashioned
            Navigation</a>.</p>

            <p>The heading indicator is an important aid because
            the compass is subject to errors caused by
            acceleration, deceleration, and the curvature of the
            earth's magnetic field, especially at high latitudes.
            The compass often oscillates or leads or lags a turn
            and it is especially hard to read in turbulence or
            during maneuvers. (To see how difficult it is to fly
            with only a compass, you can display a compass in a
            separate window.) To display or hide the magnetic
            compass, press <strong>SHIFT+5</strong>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How the Heading Indicator Works</p>

            <p>The gyro in the heading indicator rotates in the
            vertical plane. A card marked with headings maintains
            its orientation as the airplane turns. The apparent
            movement of the card gives the pilot an immediate,
            precise indication of the airplane's heading and the
            direction in which the airplane is turning.</p>

            <p>The card is marked off in five-degree increments,
            with numbers every 30 degrees and the cardinal
            directions indicated by <strong>N</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>E</strong>,
            and <strong>W</strong>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Aligning the Heading Indicator</p>

            <p>On small aircraft like the Skyhawk SP, the pilot
            sets the heading indicator to coincide with the compass
            before takeoff and resets it periodically during flight
            to make sure that it remains in sync with the compass.
            The heading indicator drifts because it's based on a
            gyro, which precesses with time. As a rule, the heading
            should drift no more than three degrees every 15
            minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To reset or adjust the heading indicator
            manually, press <strong>D</strong>.</p>

            <p>Larger aircraft usually have &quot;slaved&quot; heading
            indicators that automatically keep the instrument
            properly aligned with the compass.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can make the heading indicator
            drift by selecting the <strong>Gyro Drift</strong> option on the
            <strong>Instrument</strong> tab of the <strong>Preferences</strong> dialog
            box.</p><a name="TurnCoordinator"></a>

            <p>The turn coordinator is really two instruments. The
            gyro portion shows the aircraft's rate of
            turn&#8212;how fast it's changing direction. A ball in
            a tube called the &quot;inclinometer&quot; or &quot;slip/skid
            indicator&quot; shows the quality of the turn&#8212;whether
            the turn is &quot;coordinated.&quot;</p>

            <p>When the airplane turns, forces cause the gyro to
            precess. The rate of precession makes a miniature
            airplane on the face of the instrument bank left or
            right. The faster the turn, the greater the precession,
            and the steeper the bank of the miniature airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Standard Rate Turn</p>

            <p>When the wings of the miniature airplane align with
            the small lines next to the <strong>L</strong> and <strong>R</strong>, the
            aircraft is making a standard rate turn. For example,
            an aircraft with a standard rate of turn of three
            degrees per second will complete a 360-degree turn in
            two minutes.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Balancing Act</p>

            <p>The black ball in the slip/skid indicator stays
            between the two vertical reference lines when the
            forces in a turn are balanced and the airplane is in
            coordinated flight. If the ball drops toward the inside
            of the turn, the airplane is slipping. If the ball
            moves toward the outside of the turn, the airplane is
            skidding.</p>

            <p>To correct a skid, reduce rudder pressure being held
            in the direction of the turn and/or increase the bank
            angle.</p>

            <p>To correct a slip, add rudder pressure in the
            direction of the turn and/or decrease the bank
            angle.</p>

            <p>The autocoordination feature automatically moves the
            rudder to maintain coordinated flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Useful Backup</p>

            <p>The turn coordinator is usually electrically powered
            so that it's available if the vacuum pump fails and
            disables the attitude indicator and heading
            indicator.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Needle and Ball</p>

            <p>The turn coordinator is common in modern light
            aircraft. Older airplanes often have a similar
            instrument called the &quot;turn and slip indicator&quot; or the
            &quot;needle and ball,&quot; which uses a different presentation
            to display the same information.</p><a name=
            "VerticalSpeedIndicator"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)</p>

            <p><img src="images/CockpitBasics06.jpg" width="114"
            height="116" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>The vertical speed indicator (sometimes called the
            VSI or rate-of-climb indicator) shows how fast an
            aircraft is climbing or descending. The VSI is usually
            calibrated in feet per minute.</p>

            <p>Pilots use the VSI primarily during instrument
            flight to help them establish the correct rate of
            descent during approaches and to maintain steady rates
            of climb or descent.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How the VSI Works</p>

            <p>The VSI is connected to the static system. Air
            pressure inside the instrument case decreases as the
            airplane climbs and increases as the airplane descends.
            Inside the case, a sealed wafer&#8212;much like the one
            used in the altimeter&#8212;expands and contracts as
            the pressure changes. A needle connected to the wafer
            rotates as the wafer expands and contracts, indicating
            a rate of climb or descent. The wafer also has a small,
            calibrated leak to allow the pressure in the wafer to
            equalize with the pressure in the case. When the
            pressure inside the wafer equals the pressure in the
            case, the needle returns to zero, indicating level
            flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Reading the VSI</p>

            <p>You shouldn't use the VSI as the primary indicator
            of whether you're maintaining level flight. If the
            airplane begins to climb or descend, the VSI initially
            indicates the change in the proper direction. But the
            indicator lags the aircraft's movement and takes
            several seconds to catch up to the aircraft's actual
            rate of climb or descent. &quot;Chasing&quot; the needle on the
            VSI can make you feel like you're riding a roller
            coaster. Rely instead on the airspeed indicator and
            altimeter; they give quick, accurate indications of
            deviations from level flight. Then cross-check the VSI
            to verify that the airplane is climbing or descending
            at the rate you want.</p><a name="TrimControl"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Trim Control</p>

            <p>The trim control is like the cruise control on a
            car. It helps you maintain a specific control position
            so that the airplane stays at a particular speed or
            attitude without making you hold constant pressure on
            the controls.</p>

            <p>Most small aircraft have only one trim tab, located
            on the elevator. Larger aircraft usually have trim tabs
            on all the primary control surfaces: ailerons, rudder,
            and elevator.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Trim Control Works</p>

            <p>On small aircraft, the pilot moves the trim tab by
            rotating a wheel. The trim wheel is usually located
            below the engine controls or between the front seats.
            To apply nose-down trim, you rotate the wheel forward
            or up. To apply nose-up trim, you rotate the wheel
            backward or down.</p>

            <p>Moving the trim wheel deflects the trim tab, which
            in turn moves the control surface in the opposite
            direction. To hold the elevator up, move the trim tab
            down.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">What Trim Control Does</p>

            <p>The elevator trim compensates for the changing force
            created by the flow of air over the elevator. When the
            airplane is properly trimmed for level-cruising flight,
            you can fly &quot;hands off,&quot; applying only occasional,
            small control pressures to compensate for the
            occasional bump or minor change in heading. If you add
            power, however, the airplane speeds up, and the nose
            tends to rise because more air is flowing over the
            tail. To maintain altitude, you must apply forward
            pressure on the control yoke. Holding that forward
            pressure for more than a few minutes is fatiguing and
            difficult. To compensate, apply down elevator trim
            until the pressure disappears.</p>

            <p>If you reduce power, the airplane slows down, and
            the nose tends to fall because less air is flowing over
            the tail. To maintain altitude, you must apply back
            pressure on the yoke. To compensate, apply up elevator
            trim until the pressure disappears.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Trim for Speed</p>

            <p>You can also think of the trim control as the
            airplane speed control. For example, suppose you set
            the engine controls for cruise power and trim the
            airplane so that it flies straight and level &quot;hands
            off.&quot; The airspeed will soon stabilize at a particular
            speed. If you reduce power, the airplane slows down and
            the nose drops. If you leave the trim setting alone,
            the airplane will gradually stabilize in a descent at
            the cruise speed you established earlier. Likewise, if
            you add power, the nose will rise and the airplane will
            stabilize in a climb at about cruise speed.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Trim to Relieve Pressure, Not
            Steer</p>

            <p>Remember to use the trim control only to relieve
            control pressure. Don't try to fly the airplane with
            the trim control. If you want to change the airplane's
            pitch attitude, apply the appropriate control pressure
            on the yoke, change the power setting if necessary, and
            then adjust the trim after the airplane
            stabilizes.</p><a name="Flaps"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flaps</p>

            <p>Flaps change the shape of the wing, creating more
            lift and adding drag. These two effects allow you to
            fly at low airspeed and descend at a steep angle
            without building up speed. Flaps are not primary
            control surfaces&#8212;you don't use them to steer the
            airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">How Flaps Work</p>

            <p>Flaps extend from the trailing edge of the wing.
            They increase the curvature&#8212;or camber&#8212;of
            the wing, which increases lift. They also hang down,
            increasing drag. Pilots extend flaps in increments,
            typically measured in degrees. On most airplanes, flaps
            move in five- or ten-degree increments through a range
            of 0 (fully retracted) to about 40 degrees (fully
            extended). The first few increments add more lift than
            drag. On many aircraft, extending 5 to 15 degrees of
            flaps helps the airplane take off more quickly.</p>

            <p>As the flaps extend beyond about 20 degrees, they
            add more drag than lift. Flap settings of 20 degrees or
            higher are used for approach and landing.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Pitch Changes</p>

            <p>As you extend or retract flaps, be prepared for
            changes in pitch. For example, as you extend flaps the
            nose tends to rise. You need to add forward pressure on
            the yoke to hold the nose on the horizon, and then use
            the trim control to relieve the forward pressure.
            Likewise, as you retract flaps, the nose tends to drop,
            so be ready to add back pressure on the yoke and then
            use trim to relieve the back pressure as the airplane
            stabilizes.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Types of Flaps</p>

            <p>Flaps come in several varieties:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Plain flaps</strong> are mounted on simple hinges.
              The trailing edge of the wing simply pivots downward.
              Plain flaps are common on small aircraft because
              they're simple and inexpensive.</li>

              <li><strong>Split flaps</strong> hang down from the trailing
              edge of the wing, but the top surface of the wing
              doesn't move.</li>

              <li><strong>Slotted flaps</strong> work much like plain flaps,
              but they leave a gap between the flap and the wing,
              allowing air to flow from the bottom of the wing over
              the top surface of the flap. This airflow
              dramatically increases lift at low airspeed.</li>

              <li><strong>Fowler flaps</strong> are the most complicated and
              efficient arrangement. They move backward and
              downward as they're deployed, increasing both the
              wing's area and its curvature. Large jet aircraft
              usually have Fowler flaps.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead2">Operating the Flaps</p>

            <p>Flaps increase drag, but they aren't speed brakes.
            You can extend the flaps only when the airplane is
            flying at or below the maximum flap operating speed
            (indicated by the top of the white arc on the airspeed
            indicator). Deploying the flaps at higher speeds may
            cause structural damage.</p>

            <p>In general, extend 5 to 10 degrees of flaps before
            takeoff to help the airplane lift off the runway
            quickly. Remember, however, to follow the
            recommendations in each airplane flight manual. Retract
            the flaps after reaching a safe altitude and climb
            speed.</p>

            <p>When preparing to land, extend the flaps in
            increments. A good rule of thumb is to extend about 10
            degrees of flaps as you enter the traffic pattern or
            begin an approach. As you continue around the traffic
            pattern, add flaps in small increments. For example, in
            the Skyhawk SP, set 10 degrees of flaps on the downwind
            leg, set 20 degrees of flaps as you turn from downwind
            to base, and add flaps as necessary as you turn to
            final and approach the runway.</p>

            <p>On light aircraft, flaps are operated with levers
            located between the seats. More complex aircraft may
            have flaps located as buttons on the control panel.

            <strong>F5</strong>. To extend flaps fully, press <strong>F6</strong>. To
            retract flaps in increments, press <strong>F7</strong>. To

            "LandingGear"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Landing Gear</p>

            <p>Landing gear are the wheels, struts, and other
            equipment that an aircraft uses to land or maneuver on
            the ground, and are also known as the &quot;undercarriage.&quot;
            The two most common types of landing gear are
            &quot;taildragger&quot; and &quot;tricycle&quot; arrangements. On a
            taildragger, the front of the aircraft is supported on
            two wheels, while the tail rests on the ground on a
            skid of a tailwheel. With tricycle landing gear, the
            aircraft sits level on the ground with one nosewheel
            and two wheels farther back on the aircraft. In both
            taildragger and tricycle gear, the main landing gear
            are located nearest the airplane's center of gravity.
            Main landing gear almost always come in pairs and are
            designed to withstand a greater landing shock than the
            more-fragile nosewheel or tailwheel.</p>

            <p>Fixed landing gear cannot be retracted and lowered;
            controlling the landing gear position is not an option.
            But on retractable-gear aircraft, the gear can (and
            often must) be raised and, of course, lowered. Landing
            gear controls vary from aircraft to aircraft. To
            raise/lower the landing gear, press
            <strong>G</strong>.</p><a name="AircraftInformation"></a>
