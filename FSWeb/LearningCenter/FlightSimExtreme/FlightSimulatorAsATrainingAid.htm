            <p>If you're reading this, you've probably given Flight
            Simulator a thorough workout. You've got a handle on
            the Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172, and you've seen the
            sights, flown under the Eiffel Tower, and looped the
            747.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you're a student, a private pilot working on
            an instrument rating, or an IFR pilot who wants to stay
            proficient. Maybe you're an instructor trying to find
            new ways to teach students. In short, you're ready to
            get serious about virtual flying. Can flying Flight Simulator
            help when you take the controls of a real airplane? The
            short answer to that question is yes.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator includes several
            features&#8212;including <a href="../Multiplayer/MultiplayerIndex.htm">
			Multiplayer shared aircraft, Multiplayer
			Tower</a>, and enhanced flight analysis&#8212;that make it an excellent
            training aid. You can replay any flight and see both
            horizontal and vertical profiles. More importantly, an
            instructor can monitor another Flight Simulator pilot
            over the Internet or a local area network to offer
            help on many topics, including <a href="../theworld/weatherindex.htm">
			changing the weather</a>, 
			or <a href="../aircraft/settingfailures.htm">simulating failures</a> in the
            aircraft.</p>

            <p>Like any tool, however, Flight Simulator is only as
            useful as you make it. I'll pass along tips on how you
            can take advantage of specific features in Flight
            Simulator and make it an effective training aid. But
            first, a little background...</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Mental Game</p>
    
            <p>Most of the
            difficulties that both new students and rusty pilots
            encounter stem from misunderstandings of the principles
            or procedures behind the tasks they're trying to learn,
            not from a lack of basic motor skills. Unless you're
            trying to win aerobatic competitions, the physical part
            of flying ain't that tough.</p>

            <p>But you can't fly regulation traffic patterns, make
            smooth approaches, or impress the controllers with
            textbook holding-pattern entries unless you understand
            what you're supposed to do before you start using
            the controls. And that's where Flight Simulator comes
            in. Whether you're a student, a licensed pilot working
            on an instrument rating, or an IFR veteran trying to
            stay current, Flight Simulator is a great
            training and proficiency tool.</p>

            <p>If you're an instructor, you'll find that using
            Flight Simulator as a complement to ground instruction
            has an additional benefit. It's a great tool for
            testing your students' knowledge. With all the books,
            videos, and study guides available today, it's easy for
            students to parrot the correct answers to your favorite
            tricky questions.</p> 
			
			<p>But put students at the controls in
            Flight Simulator, give them an exercise involving a
            complex task, such as VOR navigation, and you'll soon
            determine who can apply theory to practical
            problems in real time. Most importantly, you'll find
            out before you get into the airplane where, we always
            hope, students practice and demonstrate skills that
            they already understand.</p><a name=
            "FlightSimulatorTrainingProgram"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flight Simulator as Part of a
            Training Program</p>

            <p>Using Flight Simulator as part of a training or
            proficiency program has another important benefit. It
            can help you isolate tasks and divide complicated
            procedures into manageable pieces.</p>

            <p>Like
            flash cards, Flight Simulator can help instructors and
            students focus on specific tasks and concepts. You can
            start a practice flight in the air, work on a
            particular skill, and repeat it many times
            without the distractions that occur in the world of
            real flying.</p>

            <p>In short, think of Flight Simulator as an
            inexpensive, computer-based
            procedure-and-task trainer. It brings to
            your desktop many of the same benefits that airline,
            corporate, and military pilots have had access to for
            years. Used properly and with a plan in mind, Flight
            Simulator can tone the brain&#8212;the most important
            piece of equipment in any aircraft. It's not a
            substitute for formal ground and flight instruction,
            but it can help you sharpen the 90 percent of flying
            that's mental.</p>

            <a name="Hardware"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Hardware and Other Accessories</p>

            <p>Pilots often ask me, &quot;What's the best setup for
            flying in Flight Simulator?&quot; They wonder if they need an
            expensive control yoke or joystick, rudder pedals, a
            throttle quadrant, and consoles to simulate the
            avionics stack and other aircraft controls.</p>

            <p>All of those items make Flight Simulator more fun. 
			However, I don't think you need a Flight Simulator
            full-motion simulator in your basement to use Flight Simulator
            effectively as a training aid. Certainly a joystick or
            basic yoke is important, but additional hardware is not 
			required. Regardless of how
            sophisticated your virtual cockpit is, when you climb
            into a real airplane, you will need a few hours to
            learn to identify and use all the controls and switches
            properly and get used to each airplane's unique &quot;feel,&quot;
            especially in IFR conditions. Having trained your brain with
            Flight Simulator, however, you will be a few steps
            ahead on the procedures.</p>

            <p>In addition to peripherals, you will want recent
            (but not necessarily current) aviation charts. You'll
            also learn a lot more and develop good habits if you
            have a training manual, such as the books that come
            with the multimedia courses from 
			<a href="../partners/kingschools.htm">King Schools</a>
			 and <a href="../partners/cessnaairplanecompany.htm">Cessna</a>, 
			 <a href="../partners/rodmachado.htm">Rod Machado's</a> <em>Private

            charts, and other products for Flight Simulator pilots.

            <p>Mastering air traffic control can be very intimidating for
			new pilots. Flight Simulator's Multiplayer Tower feature allows
			you to act as the air traffic controller for your students over
			the Internet or a Local Area Network.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flights</p>

            <p>Flights get you started quickly in a specific
            aircraft at a particular location, with weather, views,
            and other conditions already set up.</p>

            <p>By creating and saving a flight, you can practice
            flying an approach to your hometown airport in a stiff
            crosswind without having to repeatedly reposition the aircraft at
            the airport, adjust the weather, take off, and fly to
            the point where you want to start the approach. Set up
            everything once, save that situation as a flight, and,
            with just a couple clicks of the mouse, you can start
            flying from that position under those specific
            conditions whenever you like.</p>

            <p>Flights also come in handy when you want to practice
            a specific skill, such as flying instrument approaches,
            entering holding patterns, or VOR navigation. By
            loading a flight that begins in the air, you can jump
            right into the action and focus on the specific tasks
            at hand without spending time taking off, flying to the
            appropriate practice area, and configuring all the
            aircraft systems.</p>

            <p>If you're a devious instructor, you can also use 
			flights to create situations
            in which individual instruments or entire aircraft
            systems fail.</p>

            <p>To learn more about selecting, creating, and saving
            flights, see <a href=

            <p class="SubHead2">Weather</p>

            <p>With Flight Simulator, you can practice flying
            through the gray, moist skies of the Pacific Northwest
            even if you live in Arizona. The advanced weather
            features in Flight Simulator make it easy to create
            cloud layers, pea-soup fog, crosswinds, and other
            challenges.</p>

            <p>The ability to create low clouds and reduced
            visibility really comes in handy when you're trying to
            learn how weather affects flying. For example, you can
            set up VFR or IFR weather minimums and practice the
            transition from instrument to visual cues during the
            last stages of an approach.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Engine, System, Instrument, and
            Control Failures</p>

            <p>You can experience realistic, random failures of the
            engine, individual instruments, and entire systems in
            Flight Simulator. Instead of watching an instructor
            reach over to cover to the attitude indicator and
            therefore knowing it has &quot;failed,&quot; students must keep
            the suction gauge in their scans and be prepared to
            detect the more subtle signs of a realistic vacuum
            system failure.</p>

            <p>The failures themselves are extremely realistic. For
            example, if the vacuum system dies, the gyro in the
            attitude indicator slowly winds down and the indicator
            gradually tips and dips, just as in a real-word
            airplane with a failed vacuum pump.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Analysis</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator includes an enhanced Flight
            Analysis feature that acts much like a flight data
            recorder in a real-world airplane. It automatically
            tracks your altitude, heading, speed, and other
            information as you fly. Whenever you want to see how
            well you've followed ATC's instructions or tracked the
            localizer and glide slope on an ILS, you can play back
            the flight overlaid on a map. Using simple, VCR-like
            controls, you can rewind the flight, replay the flight,
            and pause the action.</p>

            Analysis</a>.</p><a name="MapView"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Map View</p>

            <p>The Map view in Flight Simulator is more than a tool
            for checking your position. It also shows the location
            of navigation aids, low- and high-altitude airways,
            intersections, and your track over the ground. The Map
            view also serves as an airport/facility directory in
            Flight Simulator. You can look up information about
            navigational aids, radio frequencies, airport
            elevations, and other relevant navigational details
            right from the map.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Views and Windows</p>

            <p>There's nothing quite like the view from the left
            seat of a real-world airplane. But if you're trying to
            connect what you see from the pilot's seat with the
            airplane's attitude during takeoffs, landings, and
            other maneuvers, the Flight Simulator's multiple views
            come in handy.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Videos</p>

            <p>Pilots like to admire their handiwork. For many
            years, Flight Simulator has included a Flight Video
            recorder. You can put this feature to work as a
            training aid, just as the U.S. Navy uses videos to
            review every carrier landing that a pilot makes.</p>

            <p>To learn more, see <a href=
            "../PostFlightTools/FlightVideos.htm">Flight

            <p class="SubHead2">Autopilot</p>

            <p>The autopilot in Flight Simulator can handle some of the
            flying load while you learn a new skill. When you're trying to l
			earn how ADF or VOR needles
            move as you fly complex procedures, don't complicate
            things by struggling to hold altitude and heading. Use
            the heading bug or autopilot control panel to steer the
            airplane until you thoroughly understand what's going
            on. When you're up to speed on the procedures, can
            interpret the instruments, and keep track of your
            position, you're ready to turn the autopilot off and
            juggle all the tasks simultaneously.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Slew Mode</p>

            <p>Slew mode is a handy tool for demonstrations
            and for learning to interpret navigation instruments. 
			For example, while in Cockpit view, you can
            slew around and observe how the VOR, ILS, and NDB needles
            move as you move north, south, east, and west of a
            navigation aid. Slew mode is also a quick way to
            reposition the aircraft for another landing or to enter
            the traffic pattern from another direction.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">IFR Training Panels</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator includes an IFR training panel for
            the Cessna Skyhawk SP Model 172. This
            panel&#8212;designed specifically to help pilots who
            want to learn or practice IFR skills&#8212;combines the
            flight instruments and avionics stack in one window so
            that all the important controls and instruments remain
            in view. The scenery window is small&#8212;but since
            you're &quot;in the clouds&quot; when you practice IFR
            procedures, you won't care about seeing the
            sights.</p><a name="CreativeApproaches"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Creative Approaches</p>

            <p>The list of features described earlier in this
            Handbook isn't comprehensive by any means. You can use
            other capabilities in Flight Simulator to make it an
            effective training aid. Be creative. It's also
            important to step back occasionally and look at Flight
            Simulator as more than a tool to use only when you want
            to &quot;fly.&quot; With that in mind, here are a few more tips
            aimed primarily at instructors.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">A Whiteboard for Graphically
            Challenged Instructors</p>

            <p>I've found that Flight Simulator makes an excellent
            whiteboard. By creating saved flights and Flight
            Videos, I can use Flight Simulator during a ground
            school class or pre- or post-flight briefings to
            illustrate important concepts. For example, after I
            make my best attempt to draw an FAA-recommended
            parallel entry to a holding pattern at the intersection
            of two VOR radials, I usually turn around to face a
            class that looks like a museum tour group straining to
            find the nose in a portrait by Picasso. But with Flight
            Simulator displayed on a large monitor, I can play a
            Flight Video that shows the entire class how the VOR
            needles move during that maneuver. Using the same
            technique, I can also demonstrate a specific IFR
            procedure and have students compare the instrument
            readings with details shown on a chart or approach
            plate in real time. I can press <strong>P</strong> to stop and
            start the simulation at key points along the way.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Fly Before You Fly</p>

            <p>Airline pilots take airport qualification courses
            before they fly to new airports; why shouldn't the rest
            of us? If you're heading off on a long trip to an
            unfamiliar airport, you can use Flight Simulator to
            practice the flight ahead of time. Flight Simulator
            includes the Jeppesen NavData database, so you can fly
            to more than 24,000 airports around the world; practice
            flying along low- and high-altitude airways; and become
            familiar with instrument departures, arrivals, and
            approaches before you set off on a long cross-country
            flight. You can also use Flight Simulator to practice
            circle-to-land approaches or flights into airports
            guarded by mountains or other obstructions. I like to
            have student pilots show me portions of their solo
            cross-country flights in Flight Simulator before I send
            them out alone. They gain confidence by identifying
            checkpoints visually and with VORs, understanding how
            they'll approach each airport, and considering
            alternatives if the weather or other circumstances
            require a change in plans. And I can confirm that they
            really understand the tasks involved in the flights
            they're about to make.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Don't Do This in a Real
            Airplane</p>

            <p>The airlines use sophisticated simulators primarily
            to train pilots to deal with abnormal situations and
            emergencies. You can use Flight Simulator in a similar
            way to demonstrate maneuvers and situations that aren't
            practical or safe to practice in a real airplane.</p>

            <p>For example, many pilots never really understand
            accelerated stalls and the concept that a stall can
            occur at any airspeed and with an aircraft in any
            attitude. In flight training, they experience stalls
            only with the nose at or above the horizon and at
            relatively low speed. In Flight Simulator, however, you
            can show a student what happens if, during a steep dive
            with the airspeed well into the yellow arc, you
            suddenly yank back on the yoke. I also use Flight
            Simulator to demonstrate how a steep spiral can develop
            if a pilot neglects to maintain a good instrument scan.
            Flight Simulator can also dramatically show a pilot why
            it's a bad idea to turn back to the airport if the
            engine quits shortly after takeoff.</p><a name=
            "FlyingforFun"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flying for Fun</p>

            <p>Learning is supposed to be fun. Flight Simulator is
            a great tool for setting up challenges that stimulate
            students and keep them motivated, especially when
            weather or maintenance problems cancel a real-world
            flight.</p>

            <p>You can also set up challenges for your fellow
            pilots. Dare them to record a Flight Video of their
            best ILS approaches or holding pattern entries starting
            from the same saved flight. Dig through your Jeppesen
            binders and find complex instrument departure or
            arrival procedures, and then surprise students or
            fellow pilots by asking them to fly them on the
            spot&#8212;as if ATC had spoken that dreaded phrase:
            &quot;We have an amendment to your clearance.&quot; The real work
            in such situations isn't controlling the airplane; it's
            figuring out where you are, how to set up the avionics,
            and what to do two or three steps down the road. Such
            exercises can keep your mental flying skills sharp when
            hours of routine flying leave your brain flabby. If
            you've ever wondered if you have &quot;the Right Stuff,&quot; try
            a mock Space Shuttle landing in the 737&#8211;400. Use
            the Map view to set yourself up on final approach to a
            long runway. Shut down the engines, hang out the gear,
            flaps, and spoilers, and see if you can land without
            breaking anything&#8212;and don't forget to record a
            Flight Video to send to NASA's recruiting department
            with your r&#233;sum&#233;.</p><a name="LoggingTime"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Logging Time</p>

            <p>I'm often asked if pilots can log the time they
            spend &quot;flying&quot; Flight Simulator. At present in the
            United States, the answer is no. The FAA issued
            Advisory Circular AC61&#8211;126, &quot;Qualification and
            Approval of Personal Computer-Based Aviation Training
            Devices,&quot; on May 12, 1997. With AC61&#8211;126, the FAA
            took a small, first step toward recognizing the value
            of computer-based simulations. The advisory circular
            lays out the requirements for an approved training
            device. Only a few systems have been approved thus far,
            in part because the requirements include expensive
            consoles for switches and controls. More to the point,
            even if you're using an approved PCATD, you can log
            only 10 hours of the training required for an initial
            instrument rating, provided that the practice time is
            conducted under the direct supervision of an authorized
            flight instructor. You cannot use a PCATD to log the
            approaches and other maneuvers required to maintain IFR
            currency, nor can you use an approved PCATD for
            instrument proficiency checks, to log solo time, or to
            meet any of the flight time requirements for a private
            pilot certificate.</p>
