            <p>If you can't get enough of Microsoft Flight
            Simulator, you're not alone. The Flight Simulator
            community includes thousands of individuals,
            organizations, and companies that share your passion
            for aviation. When you're ready to make your hours in
            the Flight Simulator cockpit even more rewarding,
            explore some of the suggestions below.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Flight Simulator News</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator is the best place to start
            browsing for updated or related
            information and products. Click the <strong>Home</strong> link on
            the left side of your screen.</p><a name="Add-ons"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Add-Ons</p>

            <p>Amateur and professional software developers all
            over the world have created easy-to-install products
            that can enhance your Flight Simulator experience.
            Check the shelves of your local computer store, and be
            sure to search the Web for downloadable add-ons (many
            are freeware or shareware). The Flight Simulator 
			<a href="http://www.fsinsider.com" target="_blank">FSInsider Web
            site</a> maintains links to sites with downloadable
            aircraft.</p>

            <p>If you enjoy flying a variety of aircraft, add-ons
            offer literally thousands to choose from. There are
            also add-on avionics packages that simulate the latest
            display and navigation technology, and specialized
            scenery areas that make the Flight Simulator world even
            more realistic. Or you can create
            your own add-ons with utilities that let you build aircraft, 
			panels, scenery, and adventures.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Your Desktop Cockpit</p>

            <p>If you want to make your desktop seem more like the
            cockpit of a real airplane, add some hardware. The
            options range from full desktop consoles with working
            switches down to the basics: a joystick or a yoke and
            rudder pedals. You can find these accessories at many
            computer stores and online.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Joystick or Control Yoke</p>

            <p>Although you don't need a joystick or control yoke
            to use Flight Simulator, veteran simulator pilots agree
            that it's an essential part of creating a realistic,
            enjoyable experience. There are many models to choose
            from, ranging from stripped-down, basic joysticks to
            full-blown controls with more buttons and knobs than
            you'll know what to do with. Most joysticks and control
            yokes are equipped with a built-in throttle control,
            and some also include mixture and propeller
            controls.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Rudder Pedals</p>

            <p>Real-world pilots fly using their hands and feet.
            Plug a pair of rudder pedals into your computer, and
            you'll find that you have much greater control over the
            simulated aircraft you fly. The coordinated use of
            rudder and aileron when making turns will become more
            intuitive, and you'll become a better pilot both on and
            off-screen. Rudder pedals are especially useful if you
            enjoy flying helicopters.</p> 
			
			<p class="SubHead">Virtual Airlines</p>

            <p>Once you've earned your wings in Flight Simulator
            and perhaps moved up through the ranks of Commercial
            and Airline Transport Pilot ratings in the <strong>Lessons
			</strong>, you may be ready for a new challenge:
            flying for a virtual airline. If you've always wondered
            what it would be like to be an airline pilot, this is
            your chance to find out. Scores of virtual airlines
            operate on the Web, and usually becoming a pilot for
            one of them is simply a matter of signing up and
            successfully completing their training.</p>

            <p>Each airline has its own style and emphasis. Some
            specialize in cargo operations, while others fly
            passengers. Some virtual airlines fly the latest
            glass-cockpit jetliners on routes that span continents
            and oceans, while others fly beat-up bush planes on
            island-hopping charter routes.</p>

            <p>Virtual airline training programs vary&#8212;some include
            elaborate and realistic exercises&#8212;so, if you're
            looking to learn the most from your virtual airline
            pilot career, select a virtual airline with the most
            extensive training program possible. Some training
            programs are even designed by certified flight
            instructors. If you return your training aircraft
            undamaged, chances are you'll be welcomed into the
            fleet.</p>

            <p>Once on board, you'll download the airline's
            aircraft, scenery, and training materials, and then use
            Flight Simulator to complete your assigned flights.
            You'll send reports of your flights back to the airline
            and work your way through different ratings, aircraft,
            and routes.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
            class="SideBar" summary="SummaryTBD">

                <td>
                  <p class="SubHead2">Virtual Career Advice</p>

                  <p>You'll likely begin your virtual airline
                  career flying smaller aircraft before moving up
                  to the big jets, just like in the real world.
                  Because it takes time to move up through the
                  ranks, you need to choose a virtual airline that
                  will likely stay around. To get an idea of a
                  virtual airline's longevity, it helps to
                  investigate.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Look at the training program, the routes
                    the airline flies, and the requirements to
                    maintain your active pilot status.</li>

                    <li>Get a feel for how the airline is organized
                    and managed.</li>

                    <li>Download some of the airline's aircraft and
                    take them for test flights.</li>
                  </ul>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Participating in most virtual airlines is free,
            although some charge a small fee. The virtual airline
            community on the Web is growing rapidly: new airlines
            pop up most every day, and a number of organizations
            are taking leadership roles within the community by
            providing enthusiasts with news, airline directories,
            and bulletin boards.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Pilot Supplies</p>

            <p>As a Flight Simulator pilot, you'll find many
            real-world pilot supplies useful. Find a local flight
            school or pilot's shop in the phone book, and then head
            over to see what they have. Someone there will be glad
            to show you around. (And they'll probably try to sign
            you up for flying lessons, too!) Maybe you'll become a
            student pilot; maybe you'll just walk out with an
            armload of aviation toys. Either way, it will have been
            a trip worth making.</p>

            <p>If you'd rather do your shopping from the comfort of
            home, a number of well-known pilot supply companies do
            business on the Web. Search the Web for &quot;pilot's shop.&quot;
            While you're shopping, take a look at the aviation
            charts (some stores even give them away when they're
            out-of-date), calculators, course plotters, and radio
            scanners. Most stores also stock a supply of aviation
            books on subjects such as aircraft and aircraft
            systems, weather, navigation, communications, training,
            and other topics that Flight Simulator pilots will
            appreciate.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Fly for Real</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator is a simulation and a training aid
            all rolled into one package. Many Flight Simulator
            enthusiasts go on to become licensed pilots, and many
            pilots (both recreational and professional) fire up
            Flight Simulator to have fun and practice their skills.
            It's not unusual these days for a new student to arrive
            at the airport for a first flight lesson already
            knowing about control towers, stalls, and the
            horizontal component of lift.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator provides a comfortable, relaxed
            atmosphere where pilots can learn and practice the
            fundamentals of visual and instrument flying,
            including:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Operating flight and engine controls</li>

              <li>Using and interpreting flight instruments</li>

              <li>Using navigational aids</li>

              <li>Flying in an airport environment</li>

              <li>Flying solely by reference to instruments</li>

              <li>Understanding and managing system failures</li>
			  
			  <li>Air traffic control procedure familiarity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Student pilots using Flight Simulator can isolate
            specific tasks and focus on them without the
            distractions and complexities of flying a real aircraft
            in busy airspace. Instructors can use Flight Simulator
            as an interactive tool for pre- and post-flight
            demonstrations and classroom presentations.
            Instructors find the ability to save specific
            situations as flights, to record and play back &quot;videos&quot; of
            Flight Simulator flights, and to induce failures
            particularly useful. But keep in mind that
            although Flight Simulator makes a great complement to
            flight training, it's not a substitute for instruction
            from a Certified Flight Instructor and is not part of
            an approved training program under the standards of the
            FAA or any other regulatory authority.</p>
