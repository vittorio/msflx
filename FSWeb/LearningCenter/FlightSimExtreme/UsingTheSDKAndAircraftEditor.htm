            <p>A variety of tools and processes let you create and modify Flight
            Simulator aircraft, Missions, panels and gauges, terrain, weather,
			special effects, air traffic control voicepacks, and
            scenery. To use these tools and processes (software development 
			kits or SDKs) you must at least understand Flight 
			Simulator file structures and may need some advanced 
			programming skills.</p> 
			
			<p>The <strong>Flight Simulator X Deluxe</strong> version includes
			the SDKs. You'll learn more about the skills required by reading 
			the documentation and working through the tutorials
			 that form the bulk of the SDK.</p>

			<p>The Flight Simulator X SDK is divided into four main components:</p>

				<p class="SubHead2">The Core Utilities Kit</p>
				
				<p>This includes the SimConnect SDK&#8212;the programmers 
				interface to Flight Simulator. Using SimConnect, 
				programmers can develop add-ons for the product, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Complex instruments</li>
					<li>Weather systems</li>
					<li>AI-controlled aircraft traffic</li>
					<li>Processing power for a Flight Simulator mission</li>
					<li>Logging and monitoring applications</li>
					<li>Many other possible extensions</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>However, use of this SDK 
				requires substantial programming skills in C, C++, 
				or a .NET programming language such as C#. This kit 
				also includes information on camera system extensions.</p>
				
				<p class="SubHead2">The SimObject Container Kit</p>
				
				<p>The SimObject Container Kit describes the file structure and formats 
				needed to add and modify aircraft and other simulated 
				objects (such as boats and ground vehicles, animals,
				 and hot-air balloons). A major component of this kit 
				 explains the tools and procedures required to modify aircraft 
				 panels and gauges.</p>
				
				<p class="SubHead2">The Environment Kit</p>
				
				<p>The Environment Kit is a large component that includes 
				many tools and descriptions of file formats for extending
				 the terrain and scenery in Flight Simulator.</p> 
				 
				<p>Fires and smoke are commonly-used 
				special effects. The Environment Kit includes the 
				Special Effects SDK, which makes it possible to add new 
				particle-driven graphics to scenery and aircraft.</p> 
				
				<p>This kit also includes tools for creating 3-D models 
				for aircraft and scenery objects. Finally, there are tools 
				to help create AI traffic databases.</p>
				
				<p class="SubHead2">The Mission Creation Kit<p>
				
				<p>The Mission Creation Kit explains how to create 
				Flight Simulator Missions. Missions are structured 
				flights, which can be challenges or adventures or 
				simply a fun way to educate the user by providing tasks 
				or training.</p>
