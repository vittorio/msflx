            <p>In Flight Simulator, ATC alerts you to situations in
            which certain things require your attention. Rather
            than scolding you, alert messages are designed to help
            you stay within expected parameters. Sometimes it's
            just a gentle reminder to help you stay on course, but
            also includes giving you vectors (directions) to avoid
            terrain. In most cases, you must either acknowledge the
            transmission or take the corrective action that the
            controller instructs you to take.</p><a name=
            "TrafficMessagesfromATC"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Traffic Messages from ATC</p>

            <p>You're not alone out there. Just as in the real
            world, the Flight Simulator skies are full of other
            aircraft that may conflict with your flight path. Air
            traffic controllers may advise you of potential
            conflicts using &quot;traffic calls&quot; that include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Who the controller is addressing.</li>

              <li>Where the traffic is.</li>

              <li>What the traffic is.</li>

              <li>What you should do.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS; traffic is five
              miles; two o'clock; 7,500; type 767. Report them in
              sight.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The controller in this example is addressing Cessna
            0MS. A Boeing 767 is five miles from Cessna 0MS at
            7,500 feet. &quot;Two o'clock&quot; refers to the position of the
            traffic in relation to Cessna 0MS.</p>

            <p><img src="images/OtherATCServices01.jpg" width="240"
            height="189" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>In other words, if Cessna 0MS was sitting on the
            face of a clock with its nose towards the 12, the
            little hand would point at the 2 on the clock-that is,
            the relative position at which the Boeing 767 is
            located. The controller wants to know if Cessna 0MS
            sees the traffic and wants 0MS to report if or when the
            traffic is in sight.</p>

            <p>The pilot's response might be:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Pilot: &quot;Traffic in sight, Cessna 0MS.&quot;<br>
              Or<br>
              Pilot: &quot;Traffic not in sight, Cessna 0MS.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>Warnings for traffic on parallel runways are
            different. You are warned of traffic on other runways
            if they are in the same phase of flight as you are. In
            other words, if you're landing, you'll get traffic
            warnings for aircraft landing on parallel runways. If
            you're departing, you'll get traffic warnings for
            aircraft departing on parallel runways. These warnings
            will only occur for parallel runways that are separated
            by 4,500 feet (1,372 meters) or less.</p>

            <p>Other aircraft in the Flight Simulator world are
            marked with text labels. You will see the aircraft's
            call sign attached as a text label as the aircraft
            moves. These text labels can be turned off if you don't
            want to view them. To turn off labels, see <a href=
            "../Options/ChangingTrafficSettings.htm#AircraftLabels">Turning Off
            Aircraft Labels</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Aircraft Not Seen</p>

            <p>If Cessna 0MS never sees the Boeing 767 (despite the
            size of this aircraft, it's more difficult than you
            might think to spot other planes in the sky), the
            controller may let the Cessna's pilot know when the
            traffic is no longer important. The pilot might
            hear:</p>

            <blockquote>
              Controller: &quot;Cessna 0MS, traffic no longer a factor.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p class="SubHead2">Type Unknown</p>

            <p>Sometimes, the controller can only tell the pilot
            where the traffic is relative to the pilot's position.
            In that case, the pilot hears a position report, such
            as &quot;...traffic is two o'clock...&quot; If the aircraft
            referred to in the traffic report has a Mode C
            transponder (all aircraft in Flight Simulator are Mode
            C-equipped except the Schweizer, DC-3, and Piper Cub),
            the controller can give altitude information in the
            traffic call, such as, &quot;...traffic is two o'clock,
            5,000...&quot;</p>

            <p>If the controller doesn't know the type of aircraft,
            she will simply say, &quot;...type unknown.&quot; If you have
            imported add-on aircraft into Flight Simulator, you may
            hear them referred to in traffic reports as &quot;type
            unknown.&quot;</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Traffic Alerts</p>

            <p>When traffic is close and on a course and altitude
            that could present a hazard, the controller may begin
            the traffic call with the phrase, &quot;Traffic Alert!&quot;
            That's a cue to look quickly and carefully in the
            direction of the traffic. You may have to maneuver to
            avoid a collision.</p>

            <p>When you are operating under VFR, ATC makes traffic
            calls only under certain circumstances. The controller
            may not advise you of <em>all</em> traffic that might
            conflict with your flight.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">IFR Flights and Traffic Calls</p>

            <p>If the pilot is on an IFR flight plan, ATC is
            watching the traffic around them. However, the
            controller is responsible for maintaining separation
            between aircraft within her airspace because, in
            theory, IFR aircraft are in clouds and the pilots can't
            see each other.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">VFR Flights and Traffic Calls</p>

            <p>If the pilot is operating under VFR rules, traffic
            calls are given when the pilot is transitioning
            airspace and talking to a controller, when the pilot is
            using <strong>Flight Following</strong>, and when the pilot is in
            the airport terminal airspace, provided the controller
            isn't too busy. Under VFR rules, it's the pilot's
            responsibility to maintain separation from other
            aircraft.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Speed Adjustments to Accommodate
            Traffic</p>

            <p>Controllers may also ask you to adjust your speed to
            accommodate aircraft ahead or behind you that are
            slower or faster than your aircraft.</p><a name=
            "AirspaceTransitions"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Airspace Transitions</p>

            <p>The shortest route between two points is a straight
            line, and sometimes this means flying through
            controlled airspace. Because the airspace might be busy
            or have traffic that is bigger and faster than the
            pilot's aircraft (or vice versa), it makes good sense
            for the pilot to talk to a controller while in this
            airspace. The pilot could avoid this by flying around
            the airspace (which requires that the pilot have a
            sectional chart depicting the airspace), but that might
            mean adding considerable time and distance to the
            flight.</p>

            <p>Getting a transition clearance is easy in Flight
            Simulator. Whenever you fly towards airspace in which a
            transition clearance is available or required, the ATC
            menu includes Request transition. When you select this
            item, you'll hear something like this:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Seattle Approach, Cessna N700MS, 10
              miles east of Boeing Field, 5,000. Request clearance
              to transition Seattle Class B airspace.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, Seattle<br>
              Approach, squawk 2212.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Squawk 2212, Cessna 0MS.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, radar contact seven
              miles east of Boeing Field, 5,000. Cleared through
              the Seattle Class B airspace.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The pilot has addressed the ARTCC controller in
            Seattle stating who he is, where he is, at what
            altitude he's flying, and what he wants from the
            controller. The controller called 0MS and told him to
            dial 2212 into his transponder. 0MS responded by
            reading back the squawk code. Once the controller
            acquired 0MS's target on the radar screen, the
            controller told 0MS that she had radar contact, and
            then she cleared the Cessna through Seattle's Class B
            airspace. In the case of Class D airspace, the menu
            will display the name of the controller. That way
            you'll be able to choose which towered airspace you
            want to transition.</p>

            <p>Once through the airspace, the ATC menu will contain
            the item <strong>Report clear of airspace</strong>. Select this
            item to let the controller know you're clear of the
            airspace.</p><a name="FlightFollowing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Flight Following</p>

            <p>Flight Following is a radar service for VFR aircraft
            that provides traffic advisories when the controller
            isn't too busy. It's a useful service when pilots are
            flying cross-country and may have to transition
            multiple controllers' airspaces, as they don't have to
            request a transition from each controller along the way
            and can get traffic advisories. It also means someone
            knows where they are, which can be reassuring if the
            engine quits over Death Valley or the Sahara. Keep in
            mind, however, that the pilot is still responsible for
            navigation while using Flight Following.</p>

            <p>Any time you're in airspace where Flight Following
            is available and you're VFR in Flight Simulator, the
            <strong>ATC</strong> menu lists <strong>Request Flight Following</strong>
            as one of the options. When you select this item,
            you'll hear something like this:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Seattle Center, Cessna N700MS is type
              Skylane, five miles east of Bremerton National, for

            <p>The pilot has addressed the ARTCC controller in
            Seattle stating who she is, where she is, at what
            altitude she's flying, and what she wants from the

            acquired 0MS's target on the radar screen, the
            controller told the pilot that he had radar contact and
            then gave her the current local altimeter
            setting.</p><a name="AltimeterSettings"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Altimeter Settings</p>

            <p>The altimeter provides pilots with information about
            their aircraft's altitude. In other words, it tells
            them how high above mean sea level (MSL) they are.
            Altimeters work by measuring differences in atmospheric
            pressure at different altitudes. It's critical to know
            your altitude, especially when in the clouds, and the
            altimeter reading changes depending on local
            atmospheric pressure. For a more complete explanation
            of altimeters, see <strong>Flight Academy</strong> on the left
            side of the screen.</p>

            <p>In some countries, altimeter settings are measured
            in inches of mercury, and in other countries in
            millibars. The controllers issue current local
            altimeter settings by stating the atmospheric pressure
            in inches of mercury or millibars. The pilot must then
            dial this setting into the Kollsman window of the
            altimeter (the small window on the altimeter face).</p>

            <p>Controllers often provide local altimeter readings
            when the pilot first contacts the controller. Listen
            for phraseology similar to the following:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;...current altimeter 29.92.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you hear this, check the current altimeter
            setting in your aircraft to make sure it matches the
            one the controller gave you. In Flight Simulator, you
            can choose whether the altimeter setting is in inches
            of mercury (U.S.) or millibars (metric).</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator ATC treats helicopter flights from
            the same as fixed-wing flights. You can request takeoff
            and landing clearance, and fly IFR approaches in the
            Bell 206B JetRanger III or the Robinson R22 Beta II.
            There are no special taxi or pattern-entry instructions
            issued to helicopter flights.</p>

            <p>If you call the ground controller, you'll still be
            told to taxi to a runway to takeoff. You'll have to
            hover-taxi to the runway and land just short of it
            before the menu will list tower controller options.
            Alternatively, you can just take off from your parking
            spot without ever contacting ATC. After takeoff, the
            menu changes to a list of airports at which you can
            land.</p>

            <p>ATC will not issue clearances to land on buildings,
            ships, or anywhere except an airport. You can, however,
            land a helicopter on many of the buildings in Flight
            Simulator.</p>

            <p>Although ATC does not recognize that a helicopter is
            different from any other aircraft, when you land
            directly in a parking spot, the ATC menu will
            immediately display takeoff options (as opposed to
            options for taxiing options that you would see after
            landing on a runway).</p>
