            <p>Flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC)
            is often the most challenging and interesting kind of
            flying a pilot can do. You can set weather conditions
            in Flight Simulator to be as easy or as difficult as
            you like, or even download real-world weather from the
            Web.</p>

            <p>To learn more about setting weather, see <a href=
            "../TheWorld/WeatherIndex.htm">Weather</a>. To learn
            about instrument flying, be sure to explore the
            <strong>Flight Academy</strong> link on the left side of the
            screen. For definitions of unfamiliar terms, see the
            <a href="ATCGlossary.htm">ATC Glossary</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Rendering solid overcast conditions in
            Flight Simulator requires a lot of video processing
            power. If your computer does not have sufficient power,
            Flight Simulator will automatically create
            less-than-solid overcast layers. You can adjust weather
            visuals on the <strong>Weather</strong> tab of the <strong>Display
            Settings</strong> dialog box; higher settings may decrease
            simulation performance. If you're practicing IFR
            approaches and the clouds do not form a solid overcast
            layer, try setting a low visibility layer at ground
            level.</p>

			            <p class="SubHead">Important Notes</p>
			
			<p>In multiplayer mode, you can connect over the Internet 
			or a LAN to be an air traffic tower controller for Flight 
			Simulator pilots or interact with a live Flight Simulator Tower Controller.</p>

			<p>How about live instruction on any aspect of using Flight
			 Simulator or on flying? You can give or receive instruction
			  with another pilot or a friend over the Internet or a LAN 
			  using Flight Simulator's Shared Aircraft feature in multiplayer.

            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerSharingAircraft.htm">Sharing the Aircraft in Multiplayer</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p>
			
            <p>Remember that if you use Multiplayer ATC in Flight
            Simulator, there really is no difference between ATC in
            the real world and ATC in Flight Simulator. To learn more, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerATC.htm">Multiplayer
            Air Traffic Control</a> in the Learning
            Center.

            <p class="SubHead">Getting an IFR clearance</p>

            <p>Before flying IFR in Flight Simulator, you have to
            create a flight plan or file IFR in the air. To learn
            more about using the Flight Planner, see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using the
            Flight Planner</a>. Once you've created a flight plan,
            you can call clearance delivery to get your clearance.
            It will be read to you, and you'll be required to read
            it back. All clearances in Flight Simulator are issued
            as filed, and route details are not included in the
            clearance. It's possible in rare instances that
            Approach frequency boundaries bisect an airport. When
            that happens, you might get a different departure
            frequency in your IFR clearance than you get from the
            tower when they hand you off, because you cross the
            boundary during taxi or takeoff.</p><a name=

            <p>Flight Simulator now includes the ability to open an
            IFR flight plan during flight. To file IFR in the air,
            you can open a previously created IFR flight plan while
            in flight, or create a flight plan in flight.</p>

            <p>You can request a change in cruising altitude while
            on an IFR flight plan. The option to request a change
            in altitude will not be available in the ATC menu

            <p>If for any reason during your flight you want to
            cancel IFR, you may do so. &quot;Cancel IFR&quot; appears as one
            of the menu options during most phases of an IFR
            flight. To prevent inadvertent cancellation of an IFR
            flight plan you'll be asked to confirm that you want to
            cancel IFR when you choose this menu item.</p>

            <p>If for any reason during your flight you want to
            cancel IFR, you may do so.</p>

            <p>If you cancel IFR on the way to the runway, ATC will
            instruct you to taxi to the runway to request a VFR
            departure from the tower. If you cancel IFR above
            18,000 feet, you will not be instructed to descend
            below 18,000 feet as you would be in the real
            world.</p>

            <p>ATC cancels your IFR flight plan automatically under
            the following circumstances:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>You land at your filed destination</li>

              <li>You exceed a clearance void time.</li>

              <li>You exceed a clearance and don't respond to the

              <li>You don't respond to controller
              transmissions.</li>

              <li>You're handed off to a controller and you land
              somewhere other than your destination or
              alternate.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="SubHead">ILS Approaches</p>

            <p>At Flight Simulator airports with precision
            approaches, the ILSs aligned with the active runways
            are the default instrument approaches but you can
            request a different procedure from the controller. The
            controller will vector you onto the final approach
            course unless you request the full procedure. If you
            declare a missed approach, the approach controller will
            direct you back for another attempt unless you choose a
            different action in the <strong>ATC</strong> menu.</p><a name=
            "VisualApproaches"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Visual Approaches</p>

            <p>In the real world, controllers frequently will clear
            pilots for a visual approach if conditions allow. The
            runway or airport environment must be in sight, or you
            must be able to follow other traffic to the airport to
            be cleared for a visual approach. When flying a
            precision approach in Flight Simulator, the ATC menu
            will include <strong>Request visual approach</strong> as soon as
            you're cleared for the ILS.</p><a name=
            "MissedApproaches"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Missed Approaches</p>

            <p>If you make the approach and either can't see the
            runway or are practicing multiple approaches, you can
            declare a missed approach. You'll be routed back onto
            the approach course to attempt the approach again. You
            can cancel IFR and request a VFR landing or choose
            another destination. The ATC menu will include
            <strong>Declare missed approach</strong> as soon as you're
            cleared for the approach.</p><a name=

            <p>You can now request to fly the full procedure during
            ILS approaches. You will obviously need the instrument
            approach plates to accomplish a full procedure.

            <p>Flight Simulator ATC supports nonprecision
            approaches. Once you've been told to expect the default

            <p class="SubHead">Vectors</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, ATC issues vectors to you when
            you're making instrument approaches and when you're
            straying off your filed course. The vector includes an

            <p>You can create IFR flight plans into and out of
            uncontrolled airports in Flight Simulator. When
            departing IFR at an uncontrolled airport, ATC issues a
            clearance and a clearance void time. If you do not
            contact the departure controller by the clearance void
            time, your IFR flight plan will be cancelled. (Flight
            Simulator ATC notifies you of the cancellation.) All
            clearance void times are 30 minutes from the time that
            the clearance is read.</p>

            <p>When arriving at a nontowered airport on an IFR

            the ATC menu includes two missed approach options. You
            can choose to announce the missed approach to traffic
            on the advisory frequency, or you can bypass that
            option and choose to announce the missed approach
            directly to the approach controller. When you notify
            the approach controller, you're routed back onto the
            course to attempt the approach again. You can cancel
            IFR and request a VFR landing at this
