            <p>Large airports can be confusing places. Even for
            commercial airline pilots, moving a big airplane with
            limited visibility around an unfamiliar airport can be
            tricky. There's help, however. You can use an
            Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD), which includes
            airport diagrams for large airports. A/FDs can be
            purchased from most pilot supply stores. You can also
            check out <a href=
            "../partners/Jeppesen.htm">Jeppesen's</a> PCPilot Web
            site for information on SIMCharts.</p>

            <p>You can ask for progressive taxi instructions at
            towered airports (see <a href=
            "#GettingtotheRunway">Getting to the
            Runway</a> below), and a line will be drawn to guide
            you to the runway or to parking. Take a look at the
            following diagram. This is a top-down view of an
            airport. The layout of the runways, taxiways, and
            buildings is similar to what you'll find at airports in
            Flight Simulator. Study the way the runways, taxiways,
            and parking are laid out. This will give you some idea
            of what to expect at airports in Flight Simulator.</p>

            (ATIS/ASOS/AWOS)</p>

            <p>Selected airports have recorded or automated systems
            that give weather and non-control information to
            departing and arriving flights. The Automated Terminal
            Information Service (ATIS), Automated Surface
            Observation System (ASOS), and the Automated Weather
            Observation System (AWOS) broadcast airport information
            that is important for flight safety. These systems
            relieve frequency congestion by automating repetitive,
            but essential, information. Each time ATIS is updated
            (usually hourly or if there are changes in conditions
            at the airport), a new phonetic letter is assigned to
            the broadcast. When you tune an ATIS broadcast, you
            will hear it identified as &quot;Information &lt;<em>phonetic
            letter, such as Alfa</em>&gt;.&quot; In the real world, ASOS
            and AWOS broadcasts are updated minute-by-minute
            because they are automated systems that take weather
            readings constantly. In Flight Simulator, ASOS and AWOS
            update at the same rate as ATIS. ASOS and AWOS do not
            give an identifier when they update.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Getting to the Runway</p>

            <p>It isn't just the air above the airport that is busy
            with traffic. If you've been to an airport recently,
            you know that ground-traffic congestion is another big
            safety consideration. Moving a lot of machinery full of
            people from parking to the runway is an
            often-complicated job, and it falls to the ground
            controller to accomplish it efficiently and safely. At
            towered airports, you must make a request to taxi
            before moving from the parking area or gate.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, you can begin your flight at a
            parking spot or gate, depending on the airport and the
            type of aircraft you choose to fly (you can also start
            at the runway). If you're using autotune, the ground
            frequency is tuned for you (see Using the <em>Autotune
            feature</em> in <strong>Using ATC in Flight Simulator</strong> in
            the Learning Center). You might find it easier to
            navigate to the runway if you switch to a view outside
            the cockpit (see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingViewsAndWindows.htm">Using
            Views</a> in the Learning Center).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Parking Spots</p>

            <p>Parking spots at many airports look similar to a
            public parking lot: a big expanse of pavement with
            airplanes parked wing-to-wing. From a parking spot,
            tune to the ground control frequency and request to
            taxi to the active runway. Ground control will give you
            instructions on how they want you to proceed, and at
            larger airports, ground control will also indicate the
            specific taxiway or taxiways they want you to use en
            route to the runway. Taxi instructions will be given as
            a series of taxiway identifiers and sometimes runways.
            An example is, &quot;Taxi to Runway 16 via taxiway A G2 F
            and H,&quot; which would be spoken as, &quot;Taxi to Runway 16 via
            taxiway Alpha, Golf Two, Foxtrot, and Hotel.&quot;</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Parking gates</p>

            <p>You probably know from flying on commercial
            airliners that the big boys don't usually park in
            parking spots at huge commercial airports. They park at
            what is termed a &quot;gate.&quot; A gate is attached to a
            terminal building, and in the real world, the gate is
            often permanently assigned to a particular airline.
            Gates are not assigned to a particular airline in
            Flight Simulator.</p>

            <p>From a gate, you'll need a &quot;push back&quot; (see next
            paragraph) from the gate before requesting to taxi to
            the active runway. Ground control will give you
            instructions on how they want you to proceed, and at
            larger airports, ground control indicates the specific

            <p class="SubHead2">Pushback</p>

            <p>Most of the time, the aircraft parked at a gate in
            Flight Simulator will be the larger planes, like the
            Boeing 737, Boeing 777, and the Boeing 747. These
            planes must be pushed back from the gate before they
            can taxi to the runway. In the real world, this task is
            accomplished by a &quot;tug,&quot; a small tractor designed for
            the job. When you're parked at a gate in Flight
            Simulator, you'll need to have your aircraft pushed
            back before you can request a taxi clearance.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Progressive Taxi</p>

            <p>In the real world, pilots often fly into or out of
            unfamiliar airports. It can be confusing to determine
            how to get from parking to the runway or vice versa. In
            this situation, the pilot can request progressive taxi
            instructions from the ground controller. You can do
            this in Flight Simulator at most towered airports as
            well. When you tune (or autotune) ground control, one
            of the ATC menu items is &quot;Request Progressive Taxi.&quot;
            Select this item, and a line is drawn on the taxiway
            from your present location to the runway or parking
            space. The line is drawn directly from your position to
            the runway or parking space, so you may have to look
            around the aircraft to see where it starts. Top down
            view is helpful for seeing the progressive taxi
            line.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Active Runway</p>

            <p>ATC in Flight Simulator recognizes multiple active
            runways at airports with more than one runway. Active
            runways are determined by weather conditions, and they
            are always the runways most closely aligned with the
            wind. When you communicate your intention to take off
            or land, your message automatically includes a request
            for the default active runway, but you can request a
            different runway from the ATC menu. Once you've been
            given clearance to land, you cannot change runways.
            You'll need to exercise caution, as other aircraft will
            be arriving and departing on other runways.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Hold short instructions</p>

            <p>It's important to listen carefully to all
            instructions issued by ATC. Hold short instructions are
            issued by ground controllers when there is a potential
            for conflicting traffic. The ground controller will
            often ask you to hold short of the active runway and
            may tell you to hold short of any runways you have to
            cross on the way to the runway. If you receive a hold
            short instruction, heed the warning and acknowledge the
            controller's instruction. Taxiway hold lines consist of
            two continuous lines and two dashed lines perpendicular
            to the taxiway centerline (see the graphic in the
            Taxiway markings section).</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Traffic Patterns at Airports</p>

            <p>Imagine an intersection with a dozen or more
            highways feeding into it. If everyone just went in any
            direction they wanted, a chaotic and unsafe situation
            would be created. Similarly, traffic arriving and
            departing an airport needs to be orderly and logical.
            Pilots need to know what to expect from other pilots
            operating in the area. For this reason, there are
            standard patterns established for arriving and
            departing the airspace around airports.</p>

            <p>There are multiple active runways at some airports
            Flight Simulator. They are always the runways most
            closely aligned with the wind.</p>

            </table>

            <p>The standard pattern at most airports is a rectangle
            with left turns, but some airports have the pattern on
            the opposite side with right turns. At airports with
            multiple parallel runways, the runway on the right will
            have a right-hand pattern and the runway on the left
            will have a left-hand pattern. Right-hand patterns are
            used to avoid terrain or traffic patterns of parallel
            runways, to avoid interference with nearby airports, or
            to provide noise abatement. There are five sides, or
            &quot;legs,&quot; to the traffic pattern:</p>

            <p><strong>Downwind:</strong> The aircraft is moving in the same
            direction as the wind, and the runway is located to the
            pilot's left or right, lying parallel to her
            course.</p>

            <p><strong>Base:</strong> The wind and runway are to the pilot's
            left or right, perpendicular to her course.</p>

            <p><strong>Final:</strong> The aircraft is headed into the wind,
            and the runway is dead ahead.</p>

            <p><strong>Upwind:</strong> The aircraft is flying into the wind,
            and the runway is behind the aircraft.</p>

            <p><strong>Crosswind:</strong> Opposite of the base leg.</p>

            <p>When flying into any airport, it's good practice and
            a safe habit to contact the airport 10 to 15 miles out
            and communicate your intention to land. State where you
            are, where you're landing, and, if the airport is
            uncontrolled, how you're going to enter the pattern.
            You'll hear these position reports in Flight Simulator
            when you select a landing airport and landing type
            (full stop, touch and go, and so on) from the ATC
            menu.</p>

            <p><strong>A typical call at an uncontrolled airport might
            sound like this:</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Bremerton Traffic, Cessna N700MS is 10
              miles northwest, 2,500, inbound full stop, left
              traffic, Runway 19, Bremerton.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The pilot is announcing to other air traffic on the
            common frequency that he is 10 miles from the airport
            at 2,500 feet. The pilot intends to enter the pattern
            on the left downwind leg, land, and make a full stop on
            Runway 15 at Bremerton. You don't have to know exactly
            how far away you are in Flight Simulator because the
            distance is calculated for you. When you choose an
            arrival message from the ATC menu, you'll hear the
            distance from the airport stated in the message.</p>

            <p><strong>At a controlled airport that has ATIS, the call
            would sound like this:</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Boeing Tower, Cessna N700MSis 10 miles
              northwest, with Bravo, full stop.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The pilot addresses the controller, states the
            aircraft callsign, where he is, that he has the ATIS
            airport information (&quot;with Bravo&quot;), and that he wants
            to make afull-stop landing. The tower controller
            responds with instructions and possibly traffic
            information. The pilot is told how the controller wants
            the pilot to enter the traffic pattern.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna N700MS, Boeing Tower, make
              right traffic, Runway 31R.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>In this case, the controller tells the Cessna to
            enter the downwind for Runway 31R using &quot;right
            traffic,&quot; or making right turns in the pattern.</p>
