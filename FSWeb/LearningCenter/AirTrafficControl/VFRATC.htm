            <p>There are two sets of rules by which flights are
            conducted in most countries: visual flight rules (VFR)
            and instrument flight rules (IFR). If the weather is
            above certain established standards&#8212;roughly that
            the visibility is above the minimum for flying by
            visual reference alone&#8212;pilots may make flights by
            visual flight rules. While operating under VFR, a pilot
            may fly into and out of uncontrolled airports without
            any requirement to speak to a controller.</p>

            <p>Just as in the real world, you don't have to
            interact with ATC in Flight Simulator when flying VFR.
            In fact, Flight Simulator is even more flexible,
            because you don't have to talk with controllers even in
            VFR situations that would require communication in the
            real world.</p>

            <p>The point to remember when flying VFR in Flight
            Simulator is that ATC is there to help you. You can
            communicate when flying into airports, request
            transitions through controlled airspace, and request
            Flight Following service (see <a href=
            "OtherATCServices.htm#AirspaceTransitions">Airspace
            Transitions</a> and <a href=
            "OtherATCServices.htm#FlightFollowing">Flight
            Following</a>).</p>

            <p>Another advantage of talking with controllers while
            under VFR is that the controller will tell you about
            air traffic flying near you. The controller won't tell
            you about every aircraft, but will help keep you
            advised when the workload permits. (See <a href=
            "OtherATCServices.htm#TrafficMessegesFromATC">Traffic
            Messages</a> from ATC).</p>

            <p>You can use the Flight Planner to plan a trip from
            one airport to another in VFR conditions (see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using the
            Flight Planner</a>). By using the Flight Planner, you
            can use the GPS to follow your route and even have the
            autopilot track it for you. You're not filing a flight
            plan when you use the Flight Planner under VFR, so
            there's no flight plan that you must cancel at the end
            of your flight (as is required in the real world).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flying VFR in IFR Weather
            Conditions</p>

            <p>You will be denied permission to take off or land if
            the weather at the airport is below VFR minimums. If
            the destination airport weather turns IFR after you're
            cleared to land, however, you'll be allowed to
            land.</p>
