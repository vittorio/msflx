            <p><strong>active runway</strong><br>
            The runways to which you'll be cleared for takeoffs and
            landings by ATC. In Flight Simulator you can select a
            different active runway at airports with multiple
            runways. Active runways are the runways most closely
            aligned with the wind.</p>

            <p><strong>advisory (frequency)</strong><br>
            In Flight Simulator, similar to common traffic advisory
            frequency (CTAF). Pilots use the advisory frequency at
            nontowered airports to let other air traffic know they
            are on approach or taking off.</p>

            <p><strong>Airport/Facility Directory</strong><br>
            A United States government publication that provides
            information about airports and navigation facilities.
            Use the A/FD to get information about radio
            frequencies, runways, instrument approaches, layout of
            airports, and other details. A/FDs can be purchased at
            most pilot supply stores.</p>

            <p><strong>airspace</strong><br>
            Designated volumes of space that determine whether and
            by which controlling agency a particular area is
            controlled.</p>

            <p><strong>altimeter setting</strong><br>
            The local barometric pressure reading dialed into the
            Kollsman window of an altimeter. The setting can be
            obtained from the automated weather services in Flight
            Simulator, and is read to the pilot by ATC in some
            instances.</p>

            <p><strong>approach control</strong><br>
            An air traffic controller that directs aircraft in and
            out of congested areas. Approach usually handles
            traffic between the tower-controlled and
            center-controlled phase of flight. Approach controllers
            frequently handle departing as well as arriving
            flights.</p>

            <p><strong>ARTCC</strong><br>
            The Air Route Traffic Control Centers direct aircraft
            between the phases of IFR flight controlled by
            departure and arrival controllers. They may also handle
            VFR traffic on Flight Following.</p>

            <p><strong>ASOS (Automated Surface Observation
            System)</strong><br>
            A continuously updated (minute-by-minute) automated
            weather briefing system used at some United States
            airports. For more on ASOS, see <a href=
            "AirportATCoperations.htm">Airport ATC
            Operations</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>ATC name</strong><br>
            The name by which an aircraft is identified by ATC in
            Flight Simulator in the aircraft call sign. ATC name
            corresponds to the atc_type entry in the Aircraft.cfg
            file for each aircraft.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <p>atc_type=Cessna<br>
            atc_id_enable=1<br>
            atc_id=N700MS</p>

            <p><strong>ATIS (Automated Terminal Information
            System)</strong><br>
            A recorded airport weather briefing updated hourly (or
            when there are significant weather changes). For more
            on ATIS, see <a href="AirportATCoperations.htm">Airport
            ATC Operations</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Autotune</strong><br>
            A feature of ATC in Flight Simulator that automatically
            switches radio frequencies on the communication radio
            and transponder. Switching occurs when you select an
            item from the ATC menu that contacts a new air traffic
            controller.</p>

            <p><strong>AWOS (Automated Weather Observation
            System)</strong><br>
            A continuously updated (minute-by-minute), automated
            airport weather briefing system used at some United
            States airports. For more on AWOS, see <a href=
            "AirportATCoperations.htm">Airport ATC
            Operations</a>.</p><a name="B"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">B</p>

            <p><strong>base</strong><br>
            In airport traffic patterns, a pattern leg at right
            angles to the landing runway. Base leg connects the
            downwind leg to the extended runway
            centerline.</p><a name="C"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">C</p>

            <p><strong>call sign</strong><br>
            The identification that ATC and a pilot use for a
            particular flight or aircraft. Call signs are generally
            a combination of the aircraft type or manufacturer and
            the aircraft registration for civilian planes, a
            combination of the airline and flight number for
            airline flights, and a combination of branch of service
            and flight number for military flights. Call signs
            should always be included in any communication with ATC
            to avoid confusion about who's talking.</p>

            <p><strong>clearance delivery</strong><br>
            Clearance delivery issues IFR clearances. A clearance
            is necessary before departing on an instrument flight
            plan.</p>

            <p><strong>closed traffic</strong><br>
            A landing during which the pilot doesn't let the
            aircraft come to a complete stop before applying power
            and taking off again. This is often done to practice
            takeoffs and landings. Also known as touch and go.</p>

            <p><strong>crosswind</strong><br>
            In airport traffic patterns, a pattern leg at right
            angles to the landing runway off the departure
            end.</p><a name="D"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">D</p>

            <p><strong>departure control</strong><br>
            Departure control directs aircraft out of congested
            traffic areas. Departure usually handles traffic
            between the tower-controlled and center-controlled
            phase of flight. Departure controllers frequently
            handle arriving as well as departing flights.</p>

            <p><strong>downwind</strong><br>
            The direction the wind is blowing. In airport traffic
            patterns, downwind refers to the pattern leg flown
            parallel to the runway in the direction the wind is
            blowing (opposite to the direction of landing).</p>

            <p><strong>DPs (departure procedures)</strong><br>
            DPs are published procedures for departing a particular
            airport on an instrument flight plan. ATC in Flight
            Simulator does not include DPs in IFR
            clearances.</p><a name="E"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">E</p><a name="F"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">F</p>

            <p><strong>final</strong><br>
            In airport traffic patterns, the pattern leg directly
            along the extended runway centerline.</p>

            <p><strong>flight following</strong><br>
            A radar service for VFR aircraft that provides traffic
            advisories when the controller isn't too busy. It's a
            useful service when pilots are flying cross-country and
            may have to transition through multiple controllers'
            airspaces, as they don't have to request a transition
            from each controller along the way and can get traffic
            advisories.</p>

            <p><strong>flight plan</strong><br>
            In Flight Simulator, flight plans refer to IFR flights.
            You can create a flight plan in the Flight Planner, and
            ATC will clear you along that route. VFR routes can be
            planned using the Flight Planner, but ATC does not use
            the routing information in VFR plans for any
            communication during the flight.</p>

            <p><strong>flight level</strong><br>
            In the United States, pilots flying above 18,000 feet
            (5,486 meters) are required to set the digits in the
            altimeter's Kollsman window to 29.92. The resulting
            altimeter reading is called a flight level. When the
            Kollsman window is set to 29.92 (1013.2 millibars) and
            the altimeter reads 30,000 feet, the altitude is stated
            as, &quot;Flight Level 300 (three zero zero).&quot;</p>

            <p><strong>Flight Planner</strong><br>
            The Flight Planner is used to create IFR flight plans
            and for planning routes for VFR flights. You can access
            the entire airport database in Flight Simulator through
            the <strong>Flight Planner</strong>. To learn more about using
            this feature, see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using the
            Flight Planner</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>FSS (flight service station)</strong><br>
            Air traffic facilities that provide a variety of
            services to pilots. In Flight Simulator, remote IFR
            clearances at airports without clearance delivery are
            given on FSS frequencies.</p>

            <p><strong>full-stop landing</strong><br>
            A landing that includes a complete stop on the runway,
            or when the aircraft leaves the runway on the ground
            before taxiing back for another takeoff.</p><a name=
            "G"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">G</p>

            <p><strong>ground control</strong><br>
            Ground control directs aircraft traffic between parking
            and the runway.</p><a name="H"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">H</p>

            <p><strong>hold short</strong><br>
            When a ground or tower controller wants an aircraft to
            stop at a certain location while taxiing, the
            controller will tell the pilot to &quot;hold short.&quot; This is
            usually in reference to a runway. The entire
            instruction is, &quot;Hold short of runway X,&quot; where X is
            the runway number.</p><a name="I"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">I</p>

            <p><strong>IFR (instrument flight rules)</strong><br>
            Rules governing flights conducted under instrument
            meteorological conditions (flights conducted below VFR
            minimums).</p>

            <p><strong>IFR clearances</strong><br>
            An IFR clearance is issued by clearance delivery prior
            to departure. The clearance includes information about
            the route of flight, altitude to be flown, and the
            radio frequency for the departure controller.</p>

            <p><strong>ILS (instrument landing system)</strong><br>
            A precision approach system that includes a glide
            slope, localizer, marker beacons, and airport
            lighting.</p>

            <p><strong>instrument rated</strong><br>
            Pilots who have received the required IFR training and
            have passed both written and practical exams are
            awarded an instrument rating. They can then fly in
            weather conditions during which they fly by reference
            to the cockpit instruments.</p><a name="J"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">M</p>

            <p><strong>missed approach</strong><br>
            Declaration by a pilot on an instrument approach that
            he has reached the point designated as a missed
            approach point without seeing the runway or airport
            lighting. Declaring a missed approach also signals the
            pilot's intent to execute the published missed approach
            procedure.</p>

            <p><strong>Mode C transponder</strong><br>
            A transponder is a transmitter/receiver that returns a
            signal when interrogated by a signal from the ground.
            When a pilot dials a particular code into the
            transponder, that code shows up on controllers' radar
            screens next to the aircraft's radar image. Mode C
            provides the aircraft's altitude to the controller as
            well.</p><a name="N"></a>

            <p><strong>parking gate</strong><br>
            In Flight Simulator, parking gates are attached to
            airport terminal buildings.</p>

            <p><strong>parking spot</strong><br>
            In Flight Simulator, parking spots are usually located
            in open areas on the airport.</p>

            <p><strong>progressive taxi</strong><br>
            Progressive directions from a ground controller to a
            pilot to assist the pilot in navigating between parking
            and the runway. In Flight Simulator, <strong>Progressive
            Taxi</strong> draws a line from the user's current aircraft
            location to a runway or parking spot. Request
            progressive taxi using the ATC menu.</p>

            <p><strong>pushback</strong><br>
            The act of being pushed back from an airport terminal
            gate. This is usually done by hooking a small tug to
            the nose wheel of a large aircraft and pushing it
            backwards into the taxi lane. In Flight Simulator,
            press <strong>SHIFT+P</strong> to push back from the
            gate.</p><a name="Q"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Q</p><a name="R"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">R</p>

            <p><strong>radar contact</strong><br>
            Acquisition of the radar image of a particular aircraft
            by the controller. A controller issues a transponder
            code to a pilot, and the pilot sets the code into the
            transponder. When the controller sees the image of that
            aircraft on the radar screen, she advises the pilot she
            has radar contact.</p><a name="S"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">S</p>

            <p><strong>squawk</strong><br>
            Terminology used by air traffic controllers to request
            a pilot to set a specific code into the transponder
            radio.</p>

            <p><strong>STARs (standard terminal arrival routes)</strong><br>
            Published procedures for particular airports to get a
            flight from the en route to the approach phase of
            flight. Flight Simulator ATC does not include STARs in
            IFR approach clearances.</p><a name="T"></a>

            <p><strong>taxiway</strong><br>
            Avenues by which aircraft get to and from the runway at
            airports. By using a taxiway, the pilot avoids
            conflicts with other aircraft on the runway.</p>

            <p><strong>terminal</strong><br>
            The building through which arriving and departing
            passengers pass when getting onto or off of aircraft at
            an airport. Parking gates in Flight Simulator are
            attached to terminals.</p>

            <p><strong>touch and go</strong><br>
            A landing during which the pilot doesn't let the
            aircraft come to a complete stop before applying power
            and taking off again. This is often done to practice
            takeoffs and landings. Also known as closed
            traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>tower control</strong><br>
            The controllers in the tall towers at airports direct
            the air traffic within the airport traffic area.
            Takeoffs and landings are done under their control as
            well as transitions through their airspace.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Tower Controller</strong><br>
            A <a href="../multiplayer/multiplayerindex.htm">multiplayer feature</a>
			 that allows the user to act as a live Flight Simulator Tower Controller 
			 to manage air traffic by connecting over the Internet or a local area 
			 network (LAN). All other users joining a Tower Controller session 
			 participate as pilots.</p>

            <p><strong>transition</strong><br>
            To cross through controlled airspace. In Flight
            Simulator, you can request clearance from ATC to
            transition through controlled airspace. The ATC menu
            includes requests for transitions when you are heading
            toward airspace for which a transition is
            appropriate.</p>

            <p><strong>transponder</strong><br>
            A cockpit receiver/transmitter that receives signals
            from ground-based radar and transmits a specific code
            back to the ground-based equipment. This allows air
            traffic controllers to identify specific aircraft
            moving across their radar screens.</p><a name="U"></a>

            <p><strong>upwind</strong><br>
            In airport traffic patterns, a pattern leg parallel to
            the landing runway in the direction opposite the
            wind.</p><a name="V"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">V</p>

            <p><strong>vectors</strong><br>
            Directions given by a controller to pilots to position
            them for an approach or to avoid other aircraft. The
            directions include the direction in which pilots should
            turn (left or right) and the new compass heading they
            should fly.</p>

            must, at all times, have either the airport or the
            preceding aircraft in sight. The approach must be
            authorized by and under the control of the appropriate
            air traffic control facility. Weather at the airport
            must include a reported ceiling at or above 1,000 feet
