            <p>Airports have standard procedures for arrival and
            departure for the same reason that limited-access
            highways have standardized entrance and exit ramps.
            Standard traffic pattern procedures ensure an orderly
            flow of traffic and offer increased safety for all
            aircraft. If unique procedures were used, pilots
            arriving from distant locations would have no idea what
            to do. Airport traffic patterns are not the place for
            originality; pilots have many skills, but clairvoyance
            is not among them. By using standard procedures, every
            pilot knows what to expect from the other aircraft in
            the pattern.</p>

            <p>At most airports, you'll normally fly a standard
            traffic pattern. Think of the pattern as an airborne
            rectangle, with one of its long sides aligned with the
            active runway. The active runway is the one currently
            being used by traffic and, usually, the one most
            closely aligned into the wind. It's a fact that most
            accidents occur near an airport, so follow proper
            procedures and keep looking for other traffic!</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Downwind</p>

            <p>Parallel to the runway, about 1/2 to 1 mile from it,
            is the downwind leg, which is flown in the opposite
            direction from aircraft landing and taking off on the
            runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Base</p>

            <p>When you're flying downwind and your landing point
            lies at about a 45 degree angle behind you, you'll
            normally turn onto the base leg. Base is the place
            where you ensure that the runway is clear and there's
            no conflicting traffic, like an aircraft making a
            straight-in approach, or flying some other nonstandard
            traffic pattern.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Final</p>

            <p>The leg that overlies the runway where aircraft
            approach to land is called final. When you complete the
            turn from base to final, you should be aligned with the
            extended centerline of the runway and at least 1/4 mile
            from its end, to give you time to get established
            properly for the landing itself.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Upwind</p>

            <p>Assume you want to get a good look at the runway
            before landing. You would fly parallel to the runway in
            the direction of landing, but offset to the side away
            from the pattern. It's called the upwind leg and it
            affords you a bird's eye view of the runway. If, for
            some reason, you abort a landing approach and do a
            &quot;go-around&quot; or &quot;balked landing,&quot; you can offset to the
            side of the runway and fly the upwind leg.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Departure</p>

            <p>An airplane taking off from the runway is said to be
            &quot;departing,&quot; and flies the departure leg.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Crosswind</p>

            <p>The short leg between the departure leg and downwind
            is called the crosswind leg.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Which Way do I Turn?</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Left-Hand Turns are Standard</p>

            <p>Traffic patterns normally use left turns because an
            airplane with side-by-side seating is usually flown
            from the left seat, and because the pilot has a better
            view out to the left. Hence, left-hand patterns are
            standard.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Right-Hand Turns May Be Used</p>

            <p>Right-hand patterns may be used at airports, or on
            designated runways, because of populated areas or some
            kind of obstruction that makes left traffic undesirable
            or unsafe. A right-hand pattern has the same shape as a
            left-hand pattern, but as you fly the pattern you make
            right turns instead of left turns.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">How Do You Know if the Pattern is
            Nonstandard?</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Airport/Facility Directory</p>

            <p>One way to learn about a nonstandard pattern is to
            look it up in the Airport/Facility Directory or other
            airport guide. That airport's information will include
            any runways that have right traffic.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">UNICOM</p>

            <p>If there's a UNICOM at the airport, the UNICOM
            operator will normally advise you when right traffic is
            used for a particular runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Traffic Pattern Indicator</p>

            <p>You can also fly over top of the airport, above
            traffic pattern altitude, and look at the traffic
            pattern indicators. These are usually located with a
            segmented circle at a prominent place at the airport.
            The center of the traffic pattern indicator represents
            the runway, and the legs represent a map depicting what
            kind of turn to make from base to final.</p>

            <p>The traffic pattern indicator, located in a
            segmented circle, represents runways 27 and 9. If you
            were landing on runway 27, you'd make left-hand turns
            from base to final&#8212;and you'd be flying standard
            left traffic for runway 27. If you were landing on
            runway 9, you would make right-hand turns from base to
            final&#8212;and you'd be flying non-standard right-hand
            traffic for that runway.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Entering and Departing the Traffic
            Pattern</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Traffic Pattern Altitude</p>

            <p>The recommended altitude for traffic pattern entry
            is 1,000 feet above the airport elevation, unless
            another altitude has been established for that airport
            or runway. Look in the Airport/Facility Directory to
            check for a nonstandard traffic pattern altitude, or
            confirm the correct pattern altitude using the radio.
            When you're descending to traffic pattern altitude,
            make slight clearing turns to check the area below and
            ahead of you for other traffic. You want to be in level
            flight at pattern altitude well before you enter the
            pattern. Descending while you're entering the pattern
            makes it harder for other pilots to see you, and you
            run the risk of descending onto another airplane.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Entering the Pattern</p>

            <p>You should enter the pattern at the runway's
            midpoint, at a 45-degree angle to the downwind leg. If
            you aim for your intended landing point on the runway,
            you'll approach at the correct angle and join the
            pattern at midfield. A 45-degree angle is best for
            entry because it provides a good view of traffic on the
            downwind leg and limits the amount of turn needed to
            join the pattern.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Departing an Airport</p>

            <p>When you take off, if you're staying in the pattern,
            start your turn to crosswind after passing the
            departure end of the runway and within 300 feet of
            pattern altitude. This helps ensure that you'll be at
            pattern altitude by the time you complete the turn from
            crosswind to downwind&#8212;and makes your airplane
            easier to spot for other traffic joining the pattern.
            If you're departing the airport you should either
            continue straight out on an extended departure leg, or
            make a 45-degree turn in the direction of the crosswind
            leg.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Special Departure Procedures</p>

            <p>Some airports have established special departure
            procedures because of noise abatement or obstructions.
            These procedures will be posted on bulletin boards, and
            sometimes on signs near the run-up area. If special
            departure procedures have been established, be sure to
            follow them; in addition to being required, this is
            courteous behavior and enhances safety for
            everyone.</p>
