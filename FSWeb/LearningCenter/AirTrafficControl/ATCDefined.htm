            <p class="SubHead">Introduction</p>

            <p>Just as on a busy highway, the tremendous volume of
            aircraft flying the skies today requires traffic
            management. Someone has to be in control of where all
            those aircraft are flying, at what altitude and speed,
            and by what route. The task falls to the various air
            traffic control agencies located in nearly every
            country around the world. Air traffic control is a
            vital component in the safety and economy of the
            nations of the world. Without a system to keep things
            moving safely, people and goods cannot be transported
            efficiently in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>In 2004, the top 30 airports in the world handled more 
			than 15,244,065 takeoffs and landings
            (per the United States Bureau of Transportation).
            Smaller busy airports often surround these big airports
            situated in heavy air-traffic areas. The
            round-the-clock coordination required to keep this
            system working is crucial. Air traffic
            controllers&#8212;the people who do the job&#8212;are
            highly trained individuals who have to take yearly
            refresher training, as well as monthly computer-based
            instruction and evaluations of their use of proper
            phraseology.</p>

            <p>There are different types of air traffic controllers
            who communicate with pilots from the time the pilot
            calls for a clearance, through taxi, takeoff, cruise,
            arrival, landing, and taxiing to parking. Some
            controllers work in the tall towers that you've seen at
            airports; others stare at a radar screen miles from any
            airport. Some serve more than one role; for example, a
            tower controller may act as a ground controller. (See
            <a href="#ToweredOperations">Towered (Controlled)
            Operations</a> later in this article.)</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Call Signs</p>

            <p>The controllers keep track of who's who on the radio
            using call signs. Call signs are composed of the
            registration letters and numbers painted on the side of
            the plane for civilian aircraft, airline flight numbers
            for airliners, and often a combination of a branch name
            and a number for military flights. Most countries use
            only letters for call signs, but the United States uses
            a combination of letters and numbers for many call
            signs. You can change the call sign of your aircraft in
            Flight Simulator (see Changing the Call Sign).</p>

            <p><strong>N700MS</strong> indicates an aircraft with the
            civilian registration &quot;N700MS.&quot; The call sign is spoken
            as &quot;November seven zero zero Mike Sierra.&quot; November, in
            this instance, is the letter with which all United
            States aircraft registrations begin.</p>

            <p><strong>World Travel 455</strong> refers to Flight 455 flown
            by World Travel Airlines. You generally say this as
            &quot;World Travel four fifty-five&quot; or &quot;World Travel four
            five five.&quot;</p>

            <p><strong>Navy 44F</strong> denotes a military flight. This is
            spoken as &quot;Navy four four Foxtrot.&quot; However, there are
            many variations of military call signs, depending on
            the branch of service, squadron designation, and what
            type of aircraft is being flown. You can search the Web
            for &quot;military call signs&quot; to see some of the real-world
            military call signs in use today.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Transponder (Squawk) Codes</p>

            <p>In addition to the call sign, an aircraft can be
            identified on radar by a &quot;squawk&quot; code. Most modern
            aircraft, from the little guys to the big planes, are
            equipped with a specialized radio called a
            transponder.</p>

            <p><img src="images/ATCDefined01.jpg" width="154"
            height="52" alt="" border="0"></p>

            <p>The pilot can dial a series of four numbers (the
            transponder code, or squawk code) into the transponder.
            The transponder code identifies the aircraft on the ATC
            radar screen.</p>

            <p>The standard real-world squawk code for VFR flight
            is 1200. If the flight is IFR (and in some instances
            while VFR) the controller will provide a squawk code to
            the pilot.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, the <strong>Autotune</strong> feature
            sets the squawk codes for you. To learn more about
            <strong>Autotune</strong>, see <a href="UsingATC.htm">Using ATC
            in Flight Simulator</a>. All of the aircraft in Flight
            Simulator&#8212;except the Schweizer 2&#8211;32
            sailplane, the DC-3, and Piper Cub&#8212;are
            transponder-equipped.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">ATC in the Real World</p>

            <p>A common misperception about the air traffic control
            system is the idea that every aircraft in the skies is
            under the control of the ATC system. Actually, aircraft
            can fly in what is called nontowered, or uncontrolled,
            airspace; in that case, they don't have to talk to
            anyone. Aircraft can also fly in controlled airspace
            under certain conditions without speaking to a
            controller. There are, however, certain conditions
            under which an aircraft is required to talk with ATC.
            For more information, see <a href=
            "UnderstandingAirspace.htm">Understanding
            Airspace</a>.</p>

            <p>There are two sets of rules by which flights are
            conducted in most countries: visual flight rules (VFR)
            and instrument flight rules (IFR).</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">VFR Flight</p>

            <p>If the weather is above certain established
            standards&#8212;which roughly means that the visibility
            is above the minimum for flying by visual reference
            alone, even though the pilot may still navigate by
            cockpit instruments&#8212;pilots may make flights by
            visual flight rules. While VFR, a pilot may fly in to
            and out of uncontrolled airports without any
            requirement to speak to a controller. VFR flights may
            also fly into airspace that requires them to speak to a
            controller.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">IFR Flight</p>

            <p>When the weather deteriorates below the VFR
            standard, pilots are required to be &quot;instrument rated&quot;
            in order to fly. It's also a requirement in many
            countries to be instrument rated to fly above a certain
            altitude (18,000 feet, or Flight Level 180, in the
            United States). Most airliners in the United States fly
            on IFR flight plans, although in Flight Simulator you
            can choose to fly an airliner VFR. While IFR, a pilot
            is required to be in communication with ATC unless they
            are in areas where coverage is not available or they
            have a radio failure. In Flight Simulator, there is ATC
            coverage over the entire world.</p>

            see <a href="IFRATC.htm">IFR Flight and ATC</a>. To

            Academy</strong> on the left side of the screen.</p><a name=
            "ATCLanguage"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">ATC Language</p>

            <p>Many student pilots are intimidated by the language
            of ATC, but it really isn't difficult to learn. It's
            structured and often abbreviated, but once you learn
            what to expect and what the appropriate response should
            be, using ATC adds more fun to your flight
            experience.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator is an ideal tool for learning to
            use the ATC system. Keep in mind that much of what you
            read about from here on is done for you automatically
            in Flight Simulator. You don't have to know exactly
            what words to use, because the phraseology is spoken
            for you and the menu displays the correct choices for
            the particular phase of flight you're in. If you make a
            selection on the ATC menu in the simulator that you
            didn't intend, you can make another. The ATC menu is
            not a multiple-choice quiz, so don't feel like there's
            a wrong answer. The items listed are options; think of
            them as paths to different results. The choice you make
            depends on what you want to do.</p>

            that reason, it often sounds like pilots and
            controllers are speaking a special language. They are;
            it's really just a type of shorthand. The phraseology
            you hear in Flight Simulator is based on standard ATC
            phraseology used in the real world.</p>

            <p>Think about the minimum amount of information you
            can give to someone and still communicate the relevant
            message; that's what you're shooting for with ATC
            communications. When you call a controller for the
            first time, the essential information is:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Which controller you are calling.</li>

              <li>Who you are.</li>

              <li>Where you are.</li>

              <li>What you want to do.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A typical transmission to a ground controller might
            fill in the blanks with the following:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Los Angeles Ground</li>

              <li>Learjet N700MS</li>

              <li>At parking</li>

              <li>Requesting taxi for takeoff</li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Los Angeles Ground, Learjet N700MS, at
              parking, requesting taxi for takeoff.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>You'll notice when responding to a communication
            from a controller that the phraseology you hear in
            Flight Simulator is often just repeating what the
            controller said, only briefer. This is how it's done in
            the real world.</p>

            <p>Here's an exchange between a pilot and controller.
            The pilot is VFR and wants to transition through the
            airspace over Boeing Field in Seattle.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Boeing Tower, Cessna N700MS is type
              Skylane, two miles west. Requesting transition.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, transition approved.
              Report clear of Boeing tower airspace.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;0MS will report clear.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The pilot makes an initial request by stating whom
            she's addressing, the aircraft call sign (spoken as
            &quot;November seven zero zero Mike Sierra&quot;), what type of
            aircraft she's flying, where she is, and what she
            wants. The controller responds by approving the
            transition and requesting that the pilot report when
            clear of the airspace. When the pilot responds, she
            only repeats the relevant portion of the controller's
            transmission, so that the controller knows the pilot
            understands the expectation. Both the pilot and
            controller always use the aircraft call sign so there
            is no misunderstanding as to who's talking or being
            addressed.</p>

            <p>If you think about ATC communications as following a
            standard, logical sequence, it's easier for you to
            become familiar with the style of communication. Some
            messages are longer and contain a bit more information,
            and some are shorter. The trick is to listen over and
            over to ATC phraseology until it becomes second
            nature.</p>

            <p>It's imperative that communications over air traffic
            control frequencies be concise and understandable.
            Cockpits can often be noisy, and radio audio is not
            always crystal clear. For this reason, the
            international flying community uses a standard phonetic
            alphabet to identify call signs and things like runway
            intersections, taxiways, and the like. Pilots and
            controllers use this alphabet, and you should memorize
            it, just like a real-world pilot, because you'll be
            hearing it in Flight Simulator ATC.</p>

            <p>The following list of controllers assumes that your
            flight is taking off and landing at controlled
            airports&#8212;in other words, airports that require
            radio communications with controllers. In Flight
            Simulator, as in the real world, you can take off and
            land at uncontrolled airports as well. (See <a href=
            "#NontoweredOperations">Nontowered Operations</a> later
            in this article.)</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Clearance Delivery: Your First
            Stop</p>

            <p>Before beginning a flight under instrument flight
            rules, you must obtain an IFR clearance from ATC. You
            have to create an IFR flight plan in Flight Simulator
            in order to get an IFR clearance (see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using the
            Flight Planner</a>). After you file an IFR flight plan,
            the first controller you'll contact to begin your
            flight is clearance delivery. This controller will read
            an IFR clearance to you that defines your destination,
            route, altitudes, and any special instructions ATC is
            expecting you to follow on your flight. You're required
            to read the clearance back to the controller.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ground Control: Taxiing to the
            Runway</p>

            <p>Before you move from the parking area, listen to the
            automated weather reporting system if one is
            available.</p>

            <p>To move from parking to the runway at controlled
            airports, you need to contact the ground
            controller&#8212;who's actually one of the controllers
            in the tower&#8212;and request to taxi to the runway.
            You should state a direction of departure in your
            request; the Flight Simulator ATC menu includes that
            choice. You can also choose to remain in the airport
            traffic pattern to practice takeoffs and landings. This
            is usually referred to as &quot;touch and go.&quot; (For more
            about traffic patterns, see <a href=
            "AirportATCoperations.htm">Airport ATC Operations</a>.)
            Your taxi instructions from ground can include detailed
            directions to the active runway. For reasons of
            ground-traffic congestion, ground control may not clear
            you all the way to the runway at first. Listen
            carefully, and don't go beyond the point to which you
            are instructed to go. You are not authorized to taxi
            until the ground controller issues instructions to do
            so. Stay on the ground frequency until you are ready
            for takeoff. Then, contact the tower.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Tower: Takeoff</p>

            <p>Once you get to the runway, complete your preflight
            checks, and are ready for takeoff, you must contact the
            tower controller. Tower controllers are in the tall
            tower that overlooks the airport's runways, and
            generally control the airspace up to 2,500 feet above
            the airport in a radius of four nautical miles around
            the airport. They use radar, visual sighting, and radio
            communications to issue clearances to take off and
            land, advise pilots of conflicting traffic, provide the
            current wind and altimeter information, and clear
            aircraft to transit the tower's airspace. Tower
            controllers in the real world usually rotate through
            assignments as clearance delivery and ground control.
            Listen carefully to any additional instructions tower
            may give you. You are not authorized to take off at the
            airport until the tower controller issues you a
            clearance to do so.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Approach/Departure</p>

            <p>At many airports, there is an approach and departure
            controller who facilitates movement of IFR flights
            (and, in certain circumstances, VFR flights) out of
            congested areas, and may issue clearances to aircraft
            transiting the airspace controlled by departure. Tower
            can hand off flights to departure at any time after
            takeoff, usually about half a mile past the end of the
            runway. The departure controller will then handle
            getting the flight through the area and onto its route.
            The actual controller for this job is often located in
            a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) building
            near a primary airport or co-located in the airport
            control tower. The same controllers handle approach and
            departure, and that's why it's not uncommon for you to
            be handed off from tower to approach control even when
            you're departing an airport. Don't let that confuse
            you.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Center</p>

            <p>The Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC, or
            simply &quot;center&quot;) controller handles a much larger area
            than other controllers. In the United States, there are
            23 ARTCC facilities, each with multistate coverage.
            These controllers work in secure buildings that are
            often not even close to an airport. As a flight
            proceeds towards its destination, it's handed off from
            one center controller to the next, until it is handed
            off to an approach controller or tower.</p>

            <p>In the United States, the areas controlled by the
            various ARTCC facilities are illustrated in the graphic
            below.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Approach</p>

            <p>Approach control provides radar and nonradar
            services to IFR and VFR aircraft arriving, departing,
            or transiting the airspace controlled by the approach
            facility. Essentially, this service gets aircraft from
            the en route phase of their flight down to the point
            where they are handed off to a tower for landing. In
            the case of IFR flights, approach may issue vectors
            (directions) to an aircraft to get them on to the final
            approach path for their destination airport. If an
            airport doesn't have a TRACON near it, this service may
            be provided by ARTCC.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Tower: Landing</p>

            <p>The goal of all flights is to end safely back on the
            ground. The tower controller at the destination airport
            handles takeoffs, landings, and transiting aircraft. On
            an IFR flight, the pilot will be instructed when to
            contact the tower controller. On a VFR flight, it's
            customary to contact the tower about 10 to 15 miles
            from the airport after listening to automated
            information about the airport. (For more information,
            see <em>Getting Airport Information</em> in <a href=
            "AirportATCoperations.htm">Airport ATC Operations</a>.)
            The tower controller issues instructions on how to
            approach the airport&#8212;that is, how to enter the
            traffic pattern&#8212;and may provide traffic and
            weather information. You are not authorized to land at
            the airport until the tower controller issues you a
            clearance to do so.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ground Control: Taxiing to
            Parking</p>

            <p>Once you turn off the active runway after landing,
            tower instructs you to contact the ground controller.
            Ground provides a route from your location to where you
            want to park. For reasons of ground-traffic congestion,
            ground control may not clear you all the way to parking
            in their first clearance. Listen carefully, and don't
            go beyond the point to which you are cleared. You are
            not authorized to taxi until the ground controller
            issues you a clearance to do so.</p>

                  <p>The Flight Simulator ATC team toured several
                  towers, TRACONs, and ARTCCs in order to
                  accurately model real-world ATC. The controllers
                  at these facilities are usually receptive to
                  giving tours to the public and strongly encourage
                  real-world pilots to see what it's like on the
                  other side of the microphone. Contact the tower
                  at your local airport for more information.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Nontowered Operations</p>

            <p>Airports that are not equipped with control
            facilities (ground, tower, approach, or departure) are
            called nontowered, or uncontrolled, airports. Pilots
            operating on or around these airports use a Common
            Traffic Advisory Frequency or CTAF (usually pronounced
            &quot;see-taf&quot;) to announce their intentions to other
            aircraft in the area. In addition, some airports have
            towers that don't operate 24 hours a day; these
            airports use CTAF when the tower is not in
            operation.</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, the ATC menu automatically
            lists CTAF message choices when operating at nontowered
            airports. When departing a CTAF airport, you should
            announce your intention to taxi and to take off. When
            you are 10 to 15 miles away from arrival at a CTAF
            airport, you should announce your intention to enter
            the traffic pattern and land. You address the other
            aircraft in the area as &quot;Traffic.&quot; By making these
            announcements, you're not only telling this information
            to pilots at the airport, you're announcing it to
            anyone else in the area listening on the same CTAF
            frequency&#8212;all the more reason to keep it brief,
            but informative.</p>

            <p>The idea behind CTAF communications is similar to
            that at controlled facilities. You want to state the
            following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Who you are talking to.</li>

              <li>Who you are.</li>

              <li>Where you are.</li>

              <li>What you want to do.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An example of a flight out of Bremerton National
            Airport near Seattle, Washington might state this
            information as follows:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Bremerton Traffic</li>

              <li>Mooney N700MS</li>

              <li>Taking off</li>

              <li>Runway 19, Bremerton</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Bremerton Traffic, Mooney N700MS,
              taking off, Runway 19, northeast departure,
              Bremerton.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>Note that the order of the sentence isn't the
            primary issue. What's important is that you tell other
            aircraft that might be operating on or near Bremerton
            National that you're about to launch into the skies
            from Runway 19 at Bremerton and that you're leaving the
            area to the northeast.</p><a name=

            <p class="SubHead">Acknowledging ATC Transmissions</p>

            <p>It's important to acknowledge the transmissions you
            receive from air traffic controllers. The pilot's
            response to a message from ATC is often an abbreviated
            read-back of the controller's message.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, turn right heading
              270, descend and maintain 15,000. Contact Seattle
              Approach on 13485. Good day.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Right to 270, maintain 15,000,
              Approach on 13485, Cessna 0MS.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>When you receive a message from ATC in Flight
            Simulator, the ATC menu automatically displays a
            selection of responses to be transmitted by you, the
            pilot.<a name="AskingATCtoRepeatMessages"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Asking ATC to Repeat Messages</p>

            <p>The standard terminology to use when asking ATC to
            repeat a transmission is to say the name of the
            controlling facility, your call sign, and &quot;say again.&quot;
            For example, an approach controller might tell you to
            turn to a certain heading, descend, and tune the
            transponder to a particular squawk code. If you didn't
            get all of that transmission, you would say, &quot;Seattle
            Approach, Cessna 700MS, say again.&quot;</p>

            <p>When the controller has transmitted a message, the
            last item in the menu is &quot;Say again.&quot; Select this menu
            item to hear the last controller message repeated.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ol>
              <li>Acknowledge instruction.</li>

              <li>Say again.</li>
            </ol><a name="GettingHandedOff"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Getting Handed Off</p>

            <p>Given the long range of many modern aircraft, it's
            not surprising that they often fly through the airspace
            of multiple controllers along the route to their
            destination. Even going from the parking area to the
            runway, a pilot will often speak to different
            controllers at controlled airports.</p>

            <p>When under the control of ATC, pilots get &quot;handed
            off&quot; from one controller to the next until they reach
            their destination. The handoff is simple: the
            controller instructs the pilot to contact the next
            controller and provides the frequency on which the
            contact should be made.</p>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, contact Boeing Tower
              on 120.6&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Going to 120.6, Cessna 0MS.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Controller:</strong> &quot;Cessna 0MS, contact Seattle
              Departure on 120.1&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;, Departure on 120.1, Cessna 0MS.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>The pilot then tunes in the new frequency and
            notifies the new controller that he is on the
            controller's frequency.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Seattle Center, World Travel 1123 is
              level at FL280.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Denver Approach, Baron N700MS with
              you.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Pilot:</strong> &quot;Jackson Departure, Learjet N700MS is
              climbing through 10,500 for FL320.&quot;
