            <p>To provide you with the best ATC system possible in
            Flight Simulator, we included the features we felt
            would provide Flight Simulator pilots with a rich and
            compelling experience. The following list details
            aspects of Flight Simulator ATC that are either
            different or enhanced from real-world ATC.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Important Notes</p>
			
			<p>In multiplayer mode, you can connect over the Internet 
			or a LAN to be an air traffic tower controller for Flight 
			Simulator pilots or interact with a live Flight Simulator Tower Controller.</p>
			
			<p>You don't have to be an expert to get started with ATC. 
			If you're a novice with ATC procedures, you can read the 
			material below, and use Flight Simulator's multiplayer to 
			find an ATC session for novices on the Internet.</p>

            <p>Remember that if you use Multiplayer ATC in Flight
            Simulator, there really is no difference between ATC in
            the real world and ATC in Flight Simulator. The
            differences listed below apply only to the
            single-player experience within the Flight Simulator
            ATC system. To learn more, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerATC.htm">Multiplayer
            Air Traffic Control</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p><a name="AirportChoices"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Airport Choices</p>

            <p>The ATC menu <strong>Select landing airport</strong> item
            displays a list of the nearest airports within a
            30-mile radius. Airports at the top of the list are
            closer than those farther down the list.</p><a name=
            "IFRRoutes"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">IFR Routes</p>

            <p>All IFR flight plans in Flight Simulator are cleared
            along the route filed in the <strong>Flight Planner</strong>. All
            IFR clearances are issued &quot;cleared as filed.&quot; Detailed
            routes are not described in the clearance.</p><a name=
            "ExpectFurtherClearance"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Expect Further Clearance</p>

            <p>If you're told to hold during an IFR flight in
            Flight Simulator, you will not be given an &quot;expect
            further clearance&quot; time. If you set up a random radio
            failure, the airspace ahead of you will not be cleared,
            as the ATC system won't know about your com failure.
            When ATC does not get a response from you, they will
            cancel your IFR flight plan.</p><a name=
            "DPsandSTARs"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">DPs and STARs</p>

            <p>Routes incorporating published DPs or STARs are not
            issued in clearances and cannot be requested in Flight
            Simulator. You can still create these routes, however,
            by customizing waypoints in the <strong>Flight Planner</strong>
            file. You will still hear ATC clear your flight &quot;as
            filed&quot; without including a DP or STAR. To learn more
            about custom waypoints in routes, see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using
            The Flight Planner</a>.</p>
			
			<a name="LostCommunications"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Lost Communications</p>

            <p>Though it is possible to lose a radio in Flight
            Simulator, ATC does not issue lost communication
            instructions. In addition, ATC will not know that
            you've lost communications. If they don't get a
            response from you, they will cancel your IFR flight
            plan. In that case, you won't be sequenced or cleared
            for landing.</p><a name="CancelingIFR"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Canceling IFR</p>

            <p>When you cancel IFR, you'll be asked to confirm that
            you want to cancel IFR. This prevents inadvertent
            cancellation of an IFR flight. If you cancel IFR on the
            way to the runway, ATC will instruct you to taxi to the
            runway to request a VFR departure from the tower. If
            you cancel IFR above 18,000 feet, you will not be
            instructed to descend below 18,000 feet as you would in
            the real world when flying within positive control
            airspace (under United States rules).</p><a name=
            "CancellationofFlightFollowing"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Cancellation of Flight
            Following</p>

            <p>You can cancel <strong>Flight Following</strong> at any time.
            If you are on Flight Following or if you are on a
            transition through controlled airspace, cancellation
            will occur when you choose to land. If you choose a
            landing airport from the ATC menu, the radio autotunes
            the airport frequency and any transition clearance or
            <strong>Flight Following</strong> is automatically cancelled
            without any further communication.</p><a name=
            "FailuretoRespond"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Failure to Respond</p>

            <p>When flying under IFR in Flight Simulator, you must
            respond to controller's instructions. Failure to
            respond to instructions by ATC will result in
            cancellation of IFR flight plans.</p><a name=
            "FlightServiceStation"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Flight Service Station (FSS)</p>

            <p>You can create IFR flight plans into and out of
            nontowered airports using the <strong>Flight Planner</strong>. If
            there is a Flight Service Station frequency at the
            departure airport, you'll receive your IFR clearance
            (including a clearance void time) on that frequency.

            flight plans by radio, are not supported in Flight
            Simulator.</p><a name="InteractingwithATC"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Interacting with ATC</p>

            <p>Unlike in the real world, you don't have to interact
            with ATC at all. You can fly through controlled
            airspace without ever calling a controller&#8212;and
            you won't be met by the authorities when you
            land.</p><a name="VFRFlightPlans"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">VFR Flight Plans</p>

            <p>The Flight Planner doesn't create VFR flight plans;
            using the <strong>Flight Planner</strong> under VFR is simply a
            tool to plan your route. In Flight Simulator, you do
            not need to cancel your flight plan when you arrive at
            your destination under VFR.</p><a name=
            "ModeCEquipment"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Mode C Equipment</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator ATC always knows your altitude and
            responds as though all radio-equipped aircraft have
            Mode C equipment, because Flight Simulator's ATC
            includes radar coverage everywhere in the world and
            receives Mode C data on all aircraft. Likewise, ATC
            announces the altitude of the non-Mode C aircraft when
            reporting them as traffic.</p><a name=
            "Emergencies"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Emergencies</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, you cannot declare an
            emergency.</p><a name="SpecialVFRandVFROnTop"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Special VFR and VFR On Top</p>

            <p>Requests for Special VFR and VFR On Top are not
            supported by ATC in Flight Simulator.</p><a name=
            "AirspaceDifferences"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Airspace Differences</p>

            <p>Although great effort has been made to make the
            airspace volumes in Flight Simulator adhere to
            real-world boundaries, some airspace will differ.
            Airspace sectors and altitude steps may not be modeled
            exactly as they are in the real world. Some boundaries
            that do not exist in the real world were created in
            Flight Simulator for the purpose of broader ATC
            coverage. Flight Simulator's ATC has perfect radar
            coverage everywhere in the world.</p><a name=
            "AirportDifferences"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Airport Differences</p>

            <p>There is a tremendous amount of audio recorded for
            Flight Simulator ATC. More than 3,000 worldwide airport
            and controlling facilities, hundreds of aircraft types
            and airline names, and hundreds of basic phrases are
            offered in 10 different voices. Nontowered airport
            names are not included, but they are, however,
            identified by their ICAO identifier. (For example,
            Crest Airpark is identified as &quot;S36&quot;).</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator airport and navigational aid data
            are based on the worldwide Jeppesen NavData database
            that was available at the time that Flight Simulator
            was developed. In some cases, that data differs from
            what you might see in the real world for various
            reasons. Given the long development cycle necessary to
            create Flight Simulator, some airport data may change
            in the real world by the time the product reaches
            retail shelves.</p><a name=
            "Three-Decimal-PlaceFrequencies"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Three-Decimal-Place Frequencies</p>

            <p>All three-decimal-place radio frequencies are
            shortened to two decimal places (for example,
            122.375=122.37).</p><a name=
            "IntersectionDepartures"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Intersection Departures</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator includes runway intersection data,
            but does not support requests for intersection
            departures. You can still make an intersection
            departure, but there is no specific ATC phraseology to
            request intersection takeoffs.</p><a name=
            "ASOSandAWOS"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">ASOS and AWOS</p>

            <p>Although real-world ASOS and AWOS use separate
            frequencies, the two services are the same in Flight
            Simulator and are reported as AWOS. AWOS does not
            update continuously in Flight Simulator; it updates
            when the weather changes or on the hour, whichever
            comes first.</p><a name="OceanOperations"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Ocean Operations</p>

            <p>Extended flights across the oceans are no different
            from any other flights in Flight Simulator. You can
            file IFR across the ocean, and you'll be handled by ATC
            during the entire flight. Unlike the real world, there
            are no areas that lack radar coverage.</p>
