            <p>If you are a real-world pilot or if you already have
            knowledge of the ATC system, you'll love using ATC in
            Flight Simulator. If you're new to ATC, we've worked
            hard to make your introduction to the system fun and
            easy. (You may also want to follow the ATC lesson in
            the Private Pilot section of <strong>Flight Academy</strong>).
            The main thing to keep in mind is that the interaction
            between pilots and air traffic controllers is a kind of
            conversation; you'll either make requests from
            controllers or respond to their instructions.</p>

			<p class="SubHead">Multiplayer ATC and Shared
            Aircraft</p>

			<p>In multiplayer mode, you can connect over the Internet 
			or a LAN to be an air traffic tower controller for Flight 
			Simulator pilots or interact with a live Flight Simulator Tower Controller.</p>

			<p>How about live instruction on any aspect of using Flight
			 Simulator or on flying? You can give or receive instruction
			  with another pilot or a friend over the Internet or a LAN 
			  using Flight Simulator's Shared Aircraft feature in multiplayer.
			To learn more, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerSharingAircraft.htm">Sharing the Aircraft in Multiplayer</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p>
			
            <p>Remember that if you use Multiplayer ATC in Flight
            Simulator, there really is no difference between ATC in
            the real world and ATC in Flight Simulator. To learn more, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerATC.htm">Multiplayer
            Air Traffic Control</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p>

            
            <p class="SubHead">Single-player ATC</p>

            <p>There are two aspects to learning ATC in Flight
            Simulator: learning the ATC system and language, and
            learning the <strong>ATC</strong> menu. Learning the system
            involves knowing who to talk to and what to expect from
            the ATC controllers who are communicating with you (for
            more information, see <a href="ATCDefined.htm">ATC
            Defined</a>). Learning ATC commands means knowing how
            to send messages to ATC that are appropriate to your
            current flight. The ATC menu displays the response
            choices available to you. To learn more, see <a href=
            "UsingATC.htm#UsingTheATCMenu">Using the ATC
            Menu</a>.</p>

            <p>When two people attempt to transmit a radio message
            at the same time on the same frequency, you hear an
            unpleasant squeal over the radio. In pilot parlance,
            this is known as getting &quot;stepped on.&quot; Stepping on
            someone else's transmission in Flight Simulator means
            ATC won't hear your transmission. Time your
            transmissions so that you don't step on other pilots or
            controllers.</p>

            <p>The next several pages explain how to choose the
            pilot voice you want to use, how to use the
            <strong>Autotune</strong> feature, how to tune radios manually,
            and other nuts and bolts of using ATC in Flight
            Simulator. Take your time, have fun, and remember: as
            real as this feels, it's a simulator. No one will yell
            at you or take your pilot certificate away if you make
            a mistake, and ATC is there to help guide you.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Changing Call Signs</p>

            <p>In Flight Simulator, you can change the ATC name of
            your aircraft, thus changing the call sign used by the
            pilot and ATC. Changing the airline name in the ATC
            Name dialog box will not change the airline livery
            painted on the outside of the aircraft.</p>

            <p>You can change your aircraft tail number to any
            combination of numbers and letters. The pilot and
            controller use the entire tail number during initial
            contact. The tail number is abbreviated to the last
            three characters of the call sign in subsequent
            contacts. If you always want to hear a short call sign
            (for example, if you never want to hear the &quot;November&quot;
            in United States call signs), create a short tail
            number.</p>

            <p>If you use the <strong>Autotune</strong> feature, Flight
            Simulator will switch radio frequencies for you
            automatically, freeing you to concentrate on flying the
            aircraft and navigating to your destination. When you
            select an item from the ATC menu to contact a new
            controller (for example, &quot;Contact Approach&quot;), the radio
            frequency changes to the new controller's frequency
            automatically.</p>

            <p>When using the <strong>Autotune</strong> feature, you may not
            hear anything on the radio until you choose an item
            from the ATC menu, (unless you're already tuned to an
            active frequency), even if there are other aircraft
            talking to ATC. Flight Simulator will not autotune the
            radio until you initiate contact by choosing a message
            from the menu.</p><a name=

            tune away from the controller in order to hear ATIS (if

            <p>Communicating with ATC in Flight Simulator mimics
            the way pilots and controllers communicate in the real
            world. For example, the pilot makes a request, followed
            by a response from the controller, or the controller
            gives an instruction, followed by a pilot
            acknowledgement. The information in this section refers 
			only to single-player ATC, not multiplayer ATC.</p>

            <p>The ATC menu is displayed within a transparent
            window that you can move and resize. The ATC menu lists
            the available commands specific to the current state of
            your flight. You can click items on the panel without
            moving the ATC menu. Some menus are layered so when you
            select an item a new menu list appears, and you have to
            make another selection before Flight Simulator will
            send the message to ATC. (See the example at the end of
            this section).</p>

            <p>At nontowered airports, Flight Simulator directs
            your ATC messages to other pilots in the area&#8212;not
            a controller&#8212;so don't expect a response.</p>

            <p>The menu does not always contain messages to
            transmit. When the menu contains messages to transmit,
            the top line in the menu will read, &quot;<strong>Choose a
            message to transmit to agent name.</strong>&quot; When the menu
            contains no messages to transmit, the top line in the
            menu will read, &quot;<strong>There are currently no messages to
            transmit to agent name.</strong>&quot;</p>
