            <p>Interactive air traffic control (ATC) is one of the
            most exciting features of Flight Simulator. You'll have
            plenty of company in the skies, and you can ask for and
            receive clearances, be warned of air traffic near you,
            get vectors, and hear controllers speaking to other
            aircraft.</p>

            <p>You do not have to interact with the ATC system in
            order to fly in Flight Simulator; ATC is an enhancement
            to the Flight Simulator world, but you can still fly
            from one place to another without communicating with
            anyone until you're ready to use the ATC system. When
            you start using ATC in Flight Simulator, take advantage
            of the Autotune feature, which can tune the radio for
            you and lessen your workload. (For more information,
            see <a href=
            "UsingATC.htm#UsingtheAutotunefeature">Using the
            Autotune Feature</a>.)</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Multiplayer ATC and Shared
            Aircraft</p>

			<p>In multiplayer mode, you can connect over the Internet 
			or a LAN to be an air traffic tower controller for Flight 
			Simulator pilots or interact with a live Flight Simulator Tower Controller.</p>

			<p>How about live instruction on any aspect of using Flight
			 Simulator or on flying? You can give or receive instruction
			  with another pilot or a friend over the Internet or a LAN 
			  using Flight Simulator's Shared Aircraft feature in multiplayer.

            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerSharingAircraft.htm">Sharing the Aircraft in Multiplayer</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p>
			
            <p>Remember that if you use Multiplayer ATC in Flight
            Simulator, there really is no difference between ATC in
            the real world and ATC in Flight Simulator. To learn more, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerATC.htm">Multiplayer
            Air Traffic Control</a> in the Learning
            Center.</p>

                  <p>No single article can provide an extensive
                  education in all the complexities of the
                  real-world air traffic control system, but after
                  reading this page you'll have enough information
                  to use the ATC system in Flight Simulator. Along
                  the way, we'll include references that will let
                  you explore the wider world of ATC and radio
                  communications. Our partner, the <a href=
                  "../partners/AOPA.htm">Aircraft Owners and Pilots
                  Association (AOPA)</a>, also offers a wealth of
                  information about all aspects of flying.</p>

            <p>Although the Learning Center's <a href=
            "ATCIndex.htm">ATC articles</a> include advanced topics
            for instrument-rated pilots, this isn't some secret
            information that you're barred from if you're a novice.
            Once you get more experience under your belt and learn
            the system, you can make use of the advanced topics,
            too. For help with unfamiliar terminology, see the
            <a href="ATCGlossary.htm">ATC Glossary</a>.</p>

            <p>If you're new to Flight Simulator, you'll have more
            fun if you first learn to fly using the <strong>Flight
            Academy</strong>. Once you feel comfortable at the controls
            of one or more of the Flight Simulator aircraft, take
            the time to read through the various <a href=
            "ATCIndex.htm">ATC articles</a> and learn how to use
            ATC and radio communications. You'll need to understand
            how the system works and have a basica familiarity with
            the language of ATC. Beginners often find the Autotune
            feature helpful; it will tune your radios to new
            frequencies automatically (see <a href=
            "UsingATC.htm#UsingtheAutotunefeature">Using the
            Autotune feature</a>).</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Intermediate Users</p>

            <p>If you're an experienced Flight Simulator user but
            are unfamiliar with air traffic control, take time to
            read through the Learning Center's <a href=
            "ATCIndex.htm">ATC articles</a>. You'll learn how the
            ATC system works and learn how to operate within that
            system in Flight Simulator.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Advanced Users</p>

            <p>If you're a pilot or experienced simulator user, you
            may want to jump to the sections <a href=

            <p>Remember to use the numbers along the top of the
            keyboard when making choices from the ATC menu. The
            numbers on the numeric keypad (usually on the right
            side of the keyboard) are assigned to other functions
            in Flight Simulator.</p>
