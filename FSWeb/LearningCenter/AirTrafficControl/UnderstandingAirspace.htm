            <p>It's not essential that you understand the way
            airspace is carved up in order to enjoy using ATC and
            radio communications in Flight Simulator. In Flight
            Simulator, the ATC menu changes according to various
            factors, some having to do with what type of airspace
            you're in or approaching. In the real world, you're
            required to speak with a controller to enter certain
            classes of airspace. But if you don't speak to a
            controller in Flight Simulator, we won't take your
            pilot certificate away.</p>

            <p>However, if you're interested in what various
            airspace classifications mean in the United States,
            read on.</p>

            above mean sea level (MSL) up to and including FL600
            (Flight Level 600, or 60,000 feet/18,288 meters).
            Unless otherwise authorized, pilots must operate under
            instrument flight rules in Class A airspace.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Class B (Bravo)</p>

            <p>Includes controlled airspace from the surface to
            10,000 feet (3,048 meters) MSL surrounding the busiest
            airports. Class B airspace volumes are individually
            tailored, but usually include airspace within 30 miles
            of the primary airport. To operate in real-world Class
            B airspace, pilots must meet certain requirements for
            certification, weather conditions, and aircraft
            equipment, although you don't need to worry about these
            factors in Flight Simulator. You're required to contact
            and receive a clearance from ATC prior to entering
            Class B airspace in the real world. If you take off
            from within Class B or Class C airspace in Flight
            Simulator, ATC behaves as though <strong>Flight
            Following</strong> service is automatic, meaning that ATC
            will handle your flight until you're out of the Class B
            or Class C airspace.</p>

            control tower and that is serviced by a Terminal Radar
            Approach Control (TRACON). Class C airspace is
            individually tailored for each airport, but it usually
            extends in a radius of five nautical miles (9.26
            kilometers), rising from the surface up to 4,000 feet,
            and then has a shelf area extending 10 nautical miles
