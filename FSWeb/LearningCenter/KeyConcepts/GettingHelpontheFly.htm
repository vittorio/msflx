            <p>In addition to modeling the experience of flying,
            Flight Simulator includes a large virtual library of
            content to help you with all aspects of using the
            product. Each of these topics is useful in its own way and
            complements the others. Take time to explore
            so you know where to go to find what you're looking
            for.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Mission Tutorials</p>

            <p>If you're new to flying or new to Flight Simulator and 
			just want fly now, try some of the Missions. Click 
			<strong>Missions</strong> on the main menu and select
			one of the tutorial Missions.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Learning Center</p>

            <p>The <strong>Learning Center</strong> works like a Web site. It
            has four tabs: <strong>Key Topics</strong>, <strong>Site Map</strong>,
            <strong>Index</strong> and <strong>Lessons</strong>. If you know 
			what you're looking for, use
            the Site Map or the Index to find an article on a
            specific topic or category. If you just want to browse
            a set of articles on important topics, use the Key
            Topics tab.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Key Topics</strong> tab features pictures that
            link you to important top-level articles. It's a good
            way to browse the Learning Center. There are links for
            everyone from novices to pros, including overviews of
            features, and articles about often-overlooked
            features.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Site Map</strong> includes a link to every article
            in the Learning Center organized by category. For
            example, if you're looking for articles on GPS or the
            Flight Planner, you'd look under Navigation in the Site
            Map. You could also find these topics easily in the
            <strong>Index</strong>. The Index also links to every article in
            the Learning Center, but it's organized like a book
            index. If you're looking for an article on raising the
            flaps or something about finding radio frequencies, the
            Index would be a good place to start.</p>
			
			<p class="SubHead2">IMPORTANT: Searching the Learning Center</p>
			
			<p>There is a very effective method for searching the Learning Center 
			content. <a href="http://toolbar.msn.com/" target="_blank">Download 
			and install the <strong>MSN Toolbar</strong></a> for free. The <strong>MSN 
			Toolbar</strong> includes a search function that will search rapidly across
			all files on your computer.</p> 
			
			<p>Just type something like 
			&#8220;optimizing&#8221; into the search box on the Windows taskbar, 
			and then select a file in the search results with a <em>.htm</em> 
			file extension.</p>
			
			<p>The <strong>Lessons</strong> tab links you to interactive
			lessons by flight instructor Rod Machado. Rod will teach you
			real-world flying skills for each level, from student level to airline
			transport pilot.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Rollover Help</p>

            <p>Rollover help is one of the most useful and most
            overlooked tools in Flight Simulator. Move the pointer
            over a button or box, and a description appears in the
            lower-left corner of the screen (see the large arrow in
            the image below).</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/GettingHelpontheFly01.jpg" width="397"
                height="299" alt="" border="0"><br>
                <span class="Figure1">Rollover Help</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In some instances, rollover help contains a
            description of the element that the pointer rests on,
            and in other cases it includes short instructions
            on how to use the button or element. Try moving the
            pointer over different parts of the screen to get an
            idea of how useful rollover help can be.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The Kneeboard</p><br>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=

                <span class="Figure1">Press SHIFT+F10 to display the
                kneeboard.</span></td>
              </tr>
            </table><br>
			
			<p>The <strong>Kneeboard</strong> is a very important information
            tool available while you're flying. The concept is
            derived from the kneeboards used by real-world pilots.
            Real-world kneeboards are usually aluminum or plastic
            boards that pilots literally strap to their knee or
            clip onto the airplane's yoke in order to keep
            information&#8212;charts, briefings, navigation logs,
            and other details charts, briefings, navigation logs,
            and other details&#8212;at hand during flight.</p>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
            class="SideBarTable" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>

                  </ul>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"
            class="SideBarTable" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Place the pointer near the top edge of the
                    kneeboard.</li>

                    <li>Hold down the left mouse button and drag
                    the kneeboard.</li>
                  </ol>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The Kneeboard includes seven pages: <strong>Briefing</strong>,
            <strong>Messages</strong>, <strong>Nav Log</strong>, 
			<strong>Keys</strong>, <strong>Checklist</strong>, 
			<strong>Reference</strong> and <strong>Mission</strong>.
            If you close the Kneeboard, the same page will appear
            when you reopen it. The kneeboard is moveable just like
            any window. For more information, see <a href=
            "../InTheCockpit/UsingTheKneeboard.htm">Using the
            Kneeboard</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Briefing</p>

            <p>All Missions include a flight
            briefing. The briefing on the kneeboard is an abbreviated
			version of the mission briefing. For
            more information, see <a href=
            "../Flights/allaboutmissions.htm">All About
            Missions</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Radio</p>

            <p>The Messages page includes a log of the ten most recent
            messages between your aircraft and ATC (in single-player
            mode only). This is especially useful when receiving IFR
            clearances or when traffic is busy and you can't
            remember what the controller said to you a few moments
            ago. The Messages page also keeps a log of Mission messages.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Nav Log</p>

            <p>Real pilots use navigation logs to keep track of
            headings, altitudes, time en route, and fuel burn. If
            you create a flight plan in Flight Simulator, the
            Flight Planner automatically generates a navigation
            log. The navigation log is also automatically written
            to the kneeboard so that you can reference it in
            flight. For more information, see <a href=
            "../Navigation/UsingTheFlightPlanner.htm">Using the
            Flight Planner</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Keys</p>

            <p>Did you forget which key raises or lowers the flaps?
            The kneeboard contains a list of all of the key
            commands. For more information, see <a href=
            "../ImportantSkills/UsingTheKeyboard.htm">Using the
            Keyboard</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Checklist</p>

            <p>Wondering where to find the correct manifold
            pressure for takeoff in the Douglas DC&#8211;3? For
            both large complex airplanes and small simple ones,
            pilots use a checklist of procedures in most phases of
            flight to ensure that they don't miss an important
            step. These checklists are specific to the model of
            airplane being flown; the kneeboard displays the
            checklist for the airplane you're currently flying.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Reference</p>

            <p>What's the &quot;never exceed&quot; (VNE) speed for the Boeing
            747&#8211;400? You'll find the answer&#8212;and other
            important information&#8212;on the Reference page of
            the kneeboard.</p>
			
			<p class="SubHead2">Mission</p>

            <p>The Mission page displays a list of the objectives for the
			current Mission.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">ToolTips</p>

            <p>You may already be familiar with ToolTips, the
            little text bubbles that appear when you pause over buttons
            or other elements. In Flight Simulator, ToolTips are
            different than rollover help. ToolTips are used only on
            the aircraft panels and, as illustrated in the picture
            below, are small pop-up windows containing labels.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator panels have dynamic ToolTips that
            display the label and instrument values. For example,
            if you hold the pointer over the altimeter, it shows
            not only the name of the instrument, but also the instrument's
            current reading.</p>
