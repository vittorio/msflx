            <p>To keep an airplane in the air&#8212;and to land it
            safely on a runway&#8212;a real-world pilot must
            understand and manage many controls. There's a lot to
            know about Flight Simulator, too, but that's part of
            the fun and challenge.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">Navigating through Flight
            Simulator</p>

            <p>After you install and start Flight Simulator, use
            the links on the left side of the screen to navigate
            among the screens.</p>

            <p>If you're an experienced Flight Simulator pilot, you
            already know a lot about flying. Your task will be to
            learn about the latest Flight Simulator
            features.</p>

            <p>If you're a new Flight Simulator pilot, you'll need
            to spend a little more time getting up to speed. The
            best way to learn involves a lot of exploring: start by
            exploring with <strong>Missions</strong>. Keep flying, 
			learning, and having fun.</p>To get
            the most out of the latest Flight Simulator features,
            you may want to try exploring in the following order:
            <a name="Home"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Home</p>

            <p>The Home page has news and insider information about Flight

			Web site</a>.</p><a name="Missions"></a>

            <p class="SubHead">Missions</p>

            <p>Missions combine story, events, and audio to create a
			more structured kind of experience than you find in Free Flight.
			The tutorial Missions help new Flight Simulator users get started
			flying and the other Missions challenge Flight Simulator veterans
			to try something new.</p>
