            <p>Flight Simulator allows you to experience the
            physics and mechanics of flight in both contemporary
            and historical aircraft. The computer models that
            Flight Simulator uses for each aircraft's handling
            characteristics, speeds, and aerodynamics are taken
            from real-world specifications. In addition to a fleet
            of realistic aircraft, Flight Simulator also includes
            more than 24,000 real-world airports, from large urban
            internationals to small grass strips. Between these
            landing places, you'll fly high above realistic
            renditions of real-world terrain, landmarks, scenic
            wonders, and full-scale cities.</p>

            <p>Although it may seem daunting at first, Flight
            Simulator also offers a wealth of content and features
            that can open the doors to its realistic world.</p>

            <p class="SubHead">The User Interface</p>

            <p>In order to understand Flight Simulator, start by
            getting a basic understanding of the user interface. It
            may help to think of Flight Simulator in terms of two
            interfaces: the <strong>game shell</strong> and the <strong>in-game
            interface</strong>.</p>

			<p class="SubHead2">The game shell</p><br>
			
            <table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" summary="SummaryTBD">
              <tr>
                <td class="LessonFigureTable"><img src=
                "images/TheBigPicture01.jpg" width="397" height=

              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The <strong>game shell</strong> appears when you start Flight
            Simulator. This part of the interface includes a
            navigation bar along its left side, which you use to
            access the simulator's various top-level features. Think of the
            game shell as your base of operations; it's from here
            that you'll create flights, select Missions, learn about flying, 
			and access all of the helpful content described below.</p><a name="Home"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Home</p>

            <p>If you have an Internet connection, <strong>Home
			</strong> provides news and information about Flight 
			Simulator. Click <strong>Home</strong> 
			on the left side of the screen.</p>
			
			<a name="FreeFlight"></a>

            <p class="SubHead2">Free Flight</p>

            <p>Free Flight is the classic Flight Simulator playground, where
			you create your own flight by choosing the type of aircraft, weather
			location, time and season, and other variables. You can make your
			flight as fun, as relaxing, or as challenging as you want. You can even 
			save the flights you create and fly them again later.</p>
			
			<a name="Missions"></a>
			
			<p class="SubHead2">Missions</p>

            <p>Missions are flights that provide a wide
			range of experiences in all parts of the Flight Simulator world
			and in all of the aircraft. Unlike flying in Free Flight, Missions
			have audio and events that add variety and complexity to the
			experience. Missions are designed to challenge anyone, 
			from novices to Flight Simulator veterans but they require varying
			degrees of knowledge and proficiency to complete. To learn more,
            see <a href="../Flights/AllAboutMissions.htm">All About
            Missions</a>.</p>
			
			<a name="Multiplayer"></a>
			
			<p class="SubHead2">Multiplayer</p>

            <p>You can act as a Flight Simulator air traffic
            controller or share the aircraft with another pilot
            over the Internet or a LAN.</p>

            <p>Direct other pilots from the control tower in
            multiplayer mode or observe air traffic from an air traffic
			controller's perspective. The multiplayer
            <strong>Tower</strong> feature provides a highly realistic level of
            air traffic control interaction in Flight Simulator. To
            learn more about <strong>Tower</strong>, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerATC.htm">Multiplayer
            Air Traffic Control</a> in the Learning Center.</p>

            <p>How about live instruction on any aspect of flying
            or using Flight Simulator? You can give or receive
            instruction with another pilot or friend over the
            Internet or a LAN using Flight Simulator's <strong>Shared
            Aircraft</strong> feature. To learn more about <strong>Shared
            Aircraft</strong>, see <a href=
            "../multiplayer/MultiplayerSharingAircraft.htm">Sharing
            the Aircraft in Multiplayer</a> in the Learning

		    <p class="SubHead2">The Learning Center</p>

            <p>The <strong>Learning Center</strong> offers a wealth of
            information about using Flight Simulator's many rich
            features. Although you navigate through the Learning
            Center like a Web site, you do not need to be connected
            to the Internet in order to access its articles.
            Each article includes links connecting you to related
            topics that help you continue exploring.</p>

            <p>The Learning Center includes four tabs:
			<ul>
			 <li><strong>Key Topics</strong> is a visual guide to
            Flight Simulator's major themes</li>
			<li><strong>Site Map</strong></li>
            offers a comprehensive table of contents to the
            Learning Center's articles</li>
			<li><strong>Index</strong> offers Learning Center articles organized

			<p><strong>Lessons</strong></p>

            <p>With renowned flight instructor Rod Machado,
            the <strong>Lessons</strong> offer ground school courses,
            starting with the most basic Student Pilot Rating
            material and progressing through the skills needed to
            fly the largest jumbo jets. After each lesson, you'll
            take to the skies to practice what you've just
            learned. Click the <strong>Learning Center</strong>
			on the left-hand menu, then click the <strong>
			Lessons</strong> tab.</p>
			
            <p class="SubHead2">Settings</p>

            <p>This section of the game shell lets you adjust
            Flight Simulator to suit your preferences, and to
            maximize your computer's performance. To learn more
            about settings, see <strong>Options</strong> in the Learning
            Center Key Topics.</p>

            <p>When you move the pointer over the buttons and
            controls in the game's screens and dialog boxes,
            descriptive text called <strong>rollover help</strong> appears
            in the lower-left corner of the Flight Simulator
            screen. Rollover help is useful for identifying shell
            elements and their functions.</p>
			
			<p>In the image above, with the cursor on the <strong>Fly Now</strong> 
			button, the rollover help for that button appears to the left.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Dialog Boxes</p>

            <p>The game shell's dialog boxes contain buttons, check
            boxes, sliders, and other elements that let you define
            Flight Simulator options. For example, on the
            <strong>Free Flight</strong> screen shown above, clicking the
            <strong>Current Aircraft/Change</strong> button displays the <strong>Select
            Aircraft</strong> dialog box.</p>

            <a name="InGameInterface"></a>
			
			<p class="SubHead">The In-Game Interface</p>

            <p>After you click <strong>Fly Now!</strong> in the game shell's
            Free Flight, Missions, Multiplayer, and
            Lessons screens, Flight Simulator's <strong>in-game
            interface</strong> takes over; you're now in the Flight
            Simulator world. By default, you're sitting in the
            cockpit of your selected aircraft with the instrument
            panel and windshield in front of you. From this vantage
            point, you can quickly access important
            information.</p>

            24,000 real-world airports.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">The Kneeboard</p>

            <p>Many real-world pilots use a kneeboard to hold
            charts and notes during flight. Likewise, Flight
            Simulator includes an electronic kneeboard that contains useful
            information for you to use while flying. To learn more,

            <p>When flying an unfamiliar aircraft, all those dials
            and buttons on the aircraft panel may seem
            intimidating. To increase your familiarity with a new
            plane, move the pointer over any panel item and wait
            for its ToolTip to appear.</p>

            <p>Dynamic ToolTips in the cockpit also show the
            current readings for various instruments. For example,
            when you point to the altimeter, its ToolTip will
            display not only the altimeter's name, but also the
            current altimeter reading.</p>

            <p>Flight Simulator's menu bar works like menu bars in
            other programs. When running the simulator in
            full-screen mode, the bar is hidden; press the
            <strong>ALT</strong> key to display the menu bar. Click a menu
            name, and then move the pointer over menu items and
            click to select.</p>
