			<p>Problems with starting multiplayer games are usually
            related to the method by which you're trying to
            connect.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Local Area Network Connections</p>

            <p>If you're having trouble connecting over a LAN, try
            connecting using the host IP address rather than
            searching for the host in the <strong>Sessions</strong> list.
			To learn more about direct connections in LAN sessions, see
			<a href="../Multiplayer/MultiplayerConnect.htm#JoinDirect"> Join Direct to Host</a>
			 and <a href="../Multiplayer/MultiplayerSettings.htm">Network Settings</a>.</p>

            <p class="SubHead2">Internet Connections</p>

            <p>The most frequent cause of problems when starting
			 an Internet multiplayer game is that a
            player's computer is not connected to the Internet. If
            you're having trouble connecting to <strong>Steam</strong> or via the
            host's IP address, check your Internet connection.</p>
			
            <p>To resolve most multiplayer issues, perform the
            steps in this article <em>in the sequence in which they
            are presented</em>. If the steps in this article do not
            resolve the issue, you may have problems with your
            network setup.</p>

            <p>Microsoft does not provide support for configuring
            personal networks, Internet service providers (ISPs), 
			firewalls, or routers. If you
            suspect that your personal network, ISP, firewall, or
            router is the cause of your issue, you should contact
            the manufacturer of your hardware or software, or the
            provider of your Internet services, for assistance in
            those areas.</p>

            <p>For information about how to contact the
            manufacturer of your particular hardware or software,

            <p>All multiplayer session participants should use the

            latest version of DirectX, visit
            <strong>www.microsoft.com/directx</strong>.</p>

            <p>If you already have the latest version of DirectX

            <p class="SubHead">Perform a Clean Boot</p><br>

            <p>When you start Microsoft Windows, other software may
            start along with the operating system. These programs,
            which may include antivirus and system utility
            programs, can interfere with Flight Simulator.
            Consequently, you may receive an error message or
            be returned to the desktop during multiplayer sessions;
            Flight Simulator may also stop responding. When you
            perform a clean boot, you prevent other programs from
            interrupting Flight Simulator.</p>

                  hacker attacks. A hardware firewall is a
                  connection routing device equipped with specific
                  data-checking settings that helps protect all of
                  the devices connected to it. A software firewall
                  resides on a single computer, helping to protect
                  that computer from external threats.</p>

                  <p><strong>hub:</strong> A device equipped with multiple

                  for communication lines from all devices on a
                  network. When data arrives at one port, it is

                  private network from unauthorized Internet users.

                  <p><strong>switch:</strong> A central device that functions
                  similarly to a hub, forwarding packets to
                  specific ports rather than broadcasting every
                  packet to every port. A switch is more efficient

            <p>Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is more than just a
            simple extension of the Plug and Play peripheral model.
            It is designed to support zero-configuration,
            &quot;invisible&quot; networking, along with automatic discovery
            for a breadth of device categories from a wide range of
            vendors.</p>

            <p>With UPnP, a device can dynamically join a network,
            obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities, and
            learn about the presence and capabilities of other
            devices&#8212;all automatically. Devices can
            subsequently communicate with each other directly,
            thereby further enabling peer-to-peer networking.</p>

            <p>If you are buying new hardware, look for the UPnP
            logo on the box. If you have UPnP hardware as part of
            your existing network, confirm that it is enabled or
